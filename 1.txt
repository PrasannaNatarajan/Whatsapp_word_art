23/08/14, 2:30 PM - Pornima Akka: There was a good old barber in Bangalore. One day a florist goes to him for a haircut. After the cut, he goes to pay the barber and the barber replies:

I am sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I am doing a Community Service. Florist is happy and leaves the shop.

The next morning when the Barber goes to open his shop, there is a "Thank You" Card and a dozen roses waiting at his door.

A Confectioner goes for a haircut and he also goes to pay the barber he again refuses to take the money. The Confectioner is happy and leaves the shop.

The next morning when the Barber goes to open his shop, there is another "Thank you" Card and a dozen Cakes waiting at his door.

A Software Engineer goes for a haircut and he also goes to pay the barber again refuses the money saying that it was a community service.

The next morning when the Barber goes to open his shop, guess what he finds there......

27/08/14, 10:48 AM - Harish Kumaraswami: A TRUE STORY-VERY SHOCKING....
Very Shocking....... . 
This is a real story of a young college girl who passed away last month in Coimbatore 
Her name was Priya. She was hit by a truck. 
She was working in a call center. She had a boy friend named Shankar. 
Both of them were true lovers. They always talked on the phone.
You would never find her without handphone. In fact she also changed her cell connection from Aircell to Vodafone, so that both of them can be on the same network, and save on the cost. She used to spend half of the day talking with shankar. Priya's family knew about their relationship. . Shankar was very close to Priya's family as well. (Just imagine their love) . 
Before she passed away she always told her friends 'If I pass away please burn me with my handphone' she also said the same thing to her parents. 
After her death, people cld'nt carry her body, A lot of them tried to do so,but still can't. Everybody had tried to carry the body, the results were the same. 
Eventually, they called a person known to one of their neighbours, who can speak with the soul of dead person and who was a friend of her father. 
He took a stick and started speaking to himself slowly.. 
After a few minutes, he said 'this girl misses something here.' Then her friends told that person about her intentions to burn her with her phone.
He then opened the grave box and place her phone and sim card inside the casket. After that they tried to carry the body. It was then moved easily and they then carried her into the van. 
All of us were shocked. Priya's parents did not inform Shankar that Priya had passed away..
After 2 weeks Shankar called Priya's mom.....
Shankar :.....'Aunty, I'm coming home today.. Cook something nice for me.
Don't tell Priya that I'm coming home today, I wanna surprise her.'
Her mother replied..... 'You come home first, I wanna tell you something very important.' 
After he came, they told him the truth about Priya. 
Shankar thinks that they were playing a fool. He was laughing and said 'don't try to fool me - tell Priya to come out, i have a gift for her. Please stop this nonsense'. 
Then they show him the original death certificate to him. 
They gave him proof to make him believe. (Shankar started to sweat) He said... 'Its not true.. We spoke yesterday.. She still calls me.
Shankar was shaking. 
Suddenly, Shankar's phone rang.. 'see this is from Priya, see this....' he showed the phone to priya's family. all of them told him to answer. he talked using the loudspeaker mode.. 
All of them heard his conversation. 
Loud and clear, no cross lines, no humming. 
It is the actual voice of Priya & there is no way others could use her sim card since it is nailed inside the grave box
They were so shocked and asked for the same person's 
(who can speak with the soul of dead person) help again. He brought his master to solve this matter.
He & his master worked for 5 hours.
Then they discovered one thing which really shocked them....

Vodafone has the best coverage 
'Where ever you go, our network follows!!!'



Don't shout at me . . . I am also looking for the idiot who sent me this.... So, now you too should forward this to all your nearest and dearest...and enjoy it like I did
27/08/14, 10:54 AM - Prasanna Natarajan: Hey there are many loop holes harish. How can she be a college student and working at a call centre.? She wanted her body burnt and not buried? (She isn't even a Christian)

07/09/14, 7:45 AM - Paiya perrippa: In some places Perfection is a Habit not Attitude!!!!

Apparently, the American Computer Giant IBM   decided to have some parts
manufactured in Japan as a trial .

In the specifications, they set standard that they will accept only three defective       piece per 10,000 piece.

When the delivery came to IBM there was a Letter accompanying with it.

'We, Japanese people, had a hard time understanding North American business practices.

But the three defective parts per 10,000 piece have been separately
manufactured and have been included in the consignment in a separate
package mentioned   - "Defective pieces as required, not for use "

08/09/14, 8:01 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: This one is hard to ignore:

Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.

John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.

Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.

John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.

Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.

Both their wives lost a child while living in the White House.

Both Presidents were shot on a Friday.

Both Presidents were shot in the head.


Now it gets really weird.

Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.

Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln.

Both were assassinated by Southerners.

Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.

Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.

Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.

John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.

Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.

Both assassins were known by their three names.

Both names are composed of fifteen letters.

Now hang on to your seat.

Lincoln was shot at the theater named "Ford."

Kennedy was shot in a car called "Lincoln" made by "Ford."

Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.

And here's the "kicker":

A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland.

A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.

AND...................:

Lincoln was shot in a theater and the assassin ran to a warehouse...

Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and the assassin ran to a theatre...           

Worth a share ...!!

17/09/14, 6:12 PM - Sathyanarayanan: Leaked story of i

Amy is the core role of story who brings things together.

Vikram plays a role of villager. Amy (NRI) plays a role of a model.

Amy comes to her birth place (vikram's village) after 16years, since childhood. She accidentally meets Vikram there. Situations brings them closer.

Once, Vikram admires her pics where she posed for her modeling. He himself dreams to be a model someday. 

Meanwhile, Amy becomes a brand ambassador for a MNC and also as a PROMOTIONAL MODEL for Olympics, Beijing. She gets this opportunity defeating the so-called villain Upen, who was former brand ambassador for that MNC.

He leaks a spam video of Amy to spoil her fame. He does a lot to it, where he gets information about Vikram and his dream too.

In the event, there comes a situation where, Upen gets spoiled by his own experiment failing him. (His own beauty gets spoiled by his attempt to spoil Amy)

His anger develops much stronger. He uses his father's chemical factory to develop a medicine to gain his beauty back. 

He wanted to test it with someone, where he remembers of Vikram, who dreams to be a model. 

He uses Vikram's dream as an opportunity and cheats him to inject the chemical into him. He also asks Vikram to body build for better results.

As a result of all this, Vikram becomes the most charming model in no time. He's being selected to be one of the top models. 

Amy admires him for such a massive looks and improvements. She starts loving him (she already admires Vikram's character in the beginning, which now getting into love). Vikram knows nothing about Amy's love.

When everything seems going fine, there begins the side effects of the chemical.

The chemical had no positive effect on Upen, which made things worse.

Interval breaks in there...

Then comes the scenes of Rapid changeover from normal Vikram to animal Vikram.

His anger grows day by day on his own beauty. When he got to know the result is due to the chemical used, his grudge on Upen gets stronger. Adding to it, he thinks Amy is also into this chemical injection.

Upen is nowhere to be found. He hides himself. Animal Vikram going in search of Upen.

Meanwhile, Amy plays a typical model, who starts hating Vikram (due to his change in luks tat became ugly). She is getting engaged to a rich guy.

There Vikram finds her and kidnaps her, (thinking he might get Upen  by kidnapping her).

But when he knows the truth, its too late.

Upen is now grown into an worse animal than Vikram.

And rest is a usual Hero versus Villain, with a slight difference of both being Animals.

Stickly speaking, I wanted to joint your school more fastly, but for the following region, too much time lost in getting slipper reservation in three-tyre compartment. I tolded I has head ache problem due to migration. Still the clerk rejected to give ticket to I and my sun.I putted a complain on station masterji. He said I to go to the lady clerk. At first she also rejected. I then pressed for long time and finally with great difficulty she gave a birth to my sun. 

Anyway I thanked the station master also because he was phully responsible for getting birth of my sun.

struggled.. 

Life is not about what 
you couldn't do so far, 
it's about what you can 
still do. 
Wait n dont ever give up..
Miracles happen every 
day....
                              
Rs.20 seems too much 
to give a beggar but it
seems okay when its 
given as tip at a fancy
restaurant.

After a whole day of 
work, Hours at the gym
seem alright but helping
your Mother out at home 
seems like a burden.

Praying to god for 3 min
takes too much time but
watching a movie for 3
hours doesn't.


Wait a whole year for
Valentine's day but we
always forget Mother's 
day.

Two poor starving kids
sitting on the pavement
weren't given even a slice 
of Bread but a painting of
them sold for lakhs of
Rupees.

We don't think twice 
About forwarding jokes 
But we will rethink about
sending this message on.

Think about It..
Make a change..

02/10/14, 7:19 AM - Paiya perrippa: A Poor Couple lived in a Small Village in India.

They had only 1 Son.

They gave him the Best Education.

Son Graduated as an Engineer in the nearby City

Eventually He got Married to a Rich Girl.

Initially, They Lived with His Parents in the Village.

Soon the Wife got Tired of Village Life & Persuaded Her Husband to Move to the City Leaving His Old Parents in the Village.

As Time went,the Husband saw an Ad in the Newspaper about a
Job Vacancy in U.S

He was Successful & Lived in U.S for 20 Years with His Wife.

Regularly, He used to Send Money to His Parents

Eventually with Time, He Stopped & Forgot about His Parents whether
They ever Existed.

Every Day He Pray & Immediately after each Prayer He used to see Someone telling Him
in a Dream that his Prayer is not Accepted.

One Day, He Related this Story to a 'Pious Aalim' who Advised Him to go Back to India to Visit His Parents.

The Man Flew to India & Reached the Boundary of His Village.

Everything was Changed over there.

He could not Find His House.

So He asked to the Head of the Village about the Whereabouts of His Parents.

The Head of the Village directed Him to a House & said: "In this House, Lives an Old Blind Lady who Lost Her Husband a Few Months Ago. She has a Son who Migrated to
US 20 Years back & Never came Back again. What an Unfortunate Man."

Son enters that Home &
Finds His Mother on the Bed.

He Tip-Toed as He did not want to Wake Her up.

He hears His Mother Whispering or Mumbling Something.

He gets Closer to Hear His Mothers Voice.

This is what His Mother was Saying: "God ! 
I am now Very Old & Blind.
My Husband just Died.
There is no One to Lower Me in My Grave when I Die. So please Send My Son to Fullfill
My Last Wish".

This is the Ending of a Story where the Prayer of a Mother is Accepted.

A Human Body can Bear only 45 Del (units) of Pain.

But at the Time of Giving Birth, A Mother feels upto 57 Del (units) of Pain.

This is similar to 20 Bones
getting Fractured, all at the Same Time.

This is just to tell U the extent, to which a Mother Loves Her Child.

So, Love Ur Mom till the End of Ur Life.

The Lady with whom U Fight almost Everyday, Suffered so much Pain
just to give U a Beautiful Life.

How many People will U Forward this to ?

I do not Mind, if I get this Message again.

I Passed it because I Love My ⓂOTHER.

10/10/14, 8:44 AM - Harish Kumaraswami: Be alert. 
There is a lady (and may be a group of people) may come to your house and ask for annual membership of Rs 200 for gas stove maintenance. She is from so called 'LPG' company which is bogus company. She carries company id and set of membership cards and chloroform as well. She may ask for using your toilet and may call her group and explain the position and situation of the house and they will break in and rob each and every thing in your house , Do not allow her into your house , instead try to inform police immediately. Currently she/this group is operating from Thane area. 

Do send this message and save someone from robbery......

10/10/14, 9:48 PM - natarajan ramu: கோவில் அதிசயங்கள்
 
அந்த காலத்தில் கோவில் கட்டும் போது ஒவ்வொரு கோவிலிலும் ஏதாவது ஒன்றை தனித்தன்மையுடன் அமைத்தனர்.
ஆனால் ஒவ்வொரு கோவிலிலும் ஏதாவது ஒரு தனிச்சிறப்பு உண்டு!

அவைகளில் சில:

1. உற்சவர் அல்லாமல் மூலவர் வீதியில் வலம் வருவது சிதம்பரம். - நடராஜ கோயில்

2. கும்பகோணம் அருகே “தாராசுரம்” என்ற ஊரில் உள்ள ஐராவதீஸ்வரர் கோவிலில்உள்ள சிற்பத்தில் வாலியும் சுக்ரீவனும் சண்டை இடும் காட்சி உள்ளது. இங்கிருந்து ராமர் சிற்பம் இருக்கும் தூண் தெரியாது. ஆனால் ராமன் அம்பு தொடுக்கும் சிற்பத்தில் இருந்து பார்த்தால் வாலி சுக்ரீவன் போர் புரியும் சிற்பம் தெரியும்.

3. தர்மபுரி மல்லிகார்ஜுன கோவிலில் உள்ள நவாங்க மண்டபத்தில் இரு தூண்களின் அடி பூமியில் படியாது.

4. கரூர் மாவட்ட குளித்தலை கடம்பவனநாதர் கோவிலில் இரட்டை நடராஜர் தரிசனம் செய்யலாம்.

5. கருடாழ்வார் நான்கு கரங்களுள் இரு கரங்களில் சங்கு சக்கரம் ஏந்தியபடி காட்சி தரும் ஸ்தலம் கும்பகோணம் அருகே வெள்ளியங்குடி. 108 திவ்யதேசத்தில் இங்குமட்டும் இது போல் காட்சி தருகிறார்.

6. நாச்சியார் கோவில் கல்கருடன் சன்னதியில் 4 பேர் தூக்குவார்கள் பின்பு 8,16, கோவில் வாசலில் 64 பேர் தூக்கி வருவார்கள் கருடனும் முகத்தில் வேர்வை துளிர்க்கும்.

7. ஸ்ரீபெரும்புதூரில் உள் ராமானுஜர் உருவம் விக்ரஹமோ, வேறு உலோகப் பொருளால் ஆன வடிவமைப்போ இல்லை. குங்குமப்பூ, பச்சை கற்பூரம் கொண்ட மூலிகைப் பொருளால் ஆனது.

8. திருநெல்வேலி-கடையம் அருகே நித்ய கல்யாணி உடனுறை விஸ்வநாதர் கோயிலில் உள்ள வில்வமரத்தில் லிங்க வடிவில் காய் காய்க்கிறது.

9 கும்பகோணம் அருகே திருநல்லூரில் உள்ள சிவலிங்கத் திருமேனி ஒரு நாளைக்கு 5 முறை வெவ்வேறு வண்ணங்களில் நிறம் மாறுவதால் “பஞ்சவர்ணேஸ்வரர்” என்று பெயர்.

10. விருதுநகர், சொக்கநாதன்புத்தூரில் உள்ள தவநந்திகேஸ்வரர் ஆலயத்தில் உள்ள நந்திக்கு கொம்போ, காதுகளே இல்லை.
 
11. ஆந்திராவில் சாமல் கோட்டை அருகே உள்ள 3 பிரதான சாலைகளில் சந்திப்பில் உள்ள 72 அடி ஆஞ்சநேயர் சிலையின் கண்களும். சில நூறு மைகளுக்கு அப்பால் உள்ள பத்ராசல ஆலயத்தில் ஸ்ரீராமன் திருவடிகளும் ஒரே மட்டத்தில் உள்ளன.

12. வேலூர் அருகே உள்ள விருஞ்சிபுரம் என்ற தலத்தில் உள்ள கோயில் elதூணின் தென்புறம் அர்த்த சந்திரவடிவில் 1 முதல் 6 வரையும், 6முதல் 12 வரையும் எண்கள் செதுக்கியுள்ளன. மேற்புறம் உள்ள பள்ளத்தில் வழியே ஒரு குச்சியை நீட்டினால், குச்சியுன் நிழல் எந்த எண்ணில் விழுகிறதோ அதுதான் அப்போது மணி ஆகும்.

> She asked, "Where is my record?"

> She said, "I don't need your compliment, I need my record?"

> "I didn't complete it yet, shall I give it tomorrow?" I asked

> "Can you remind me in the morning so I won't forget? Please and this is my

26/10/14, 6:02 PM - Paiya perrippa: A man dies and goes to hell. There he finds that there is a different hell for each country.

He goes to the German hell and asks,

"What do they do there?"

He is told, "First they put you in an electric chair for an hour.

Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour.

Then the German devil comes in and beats you for the rest of the day."

The man doesn't like it, so he moves on and checks out the American hell, the Russian hell and hells of other countries.

He finds that they're all more or less the same as the German hell.

Then he comes to the Indian hell and finds that there is a long queue of people waiting to get in.

Amazed, he asks, "What do they do here?"

He is told, "First they put you in an electric chair for an hour.

Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour.

Then the Indian devil comes in and beats you for the rest of the day."

"But that is exactly the same as all the other hells; so why are so many people waiting to get in here?" wonders the man.

He is told, "Because the maintenance here is so bad that the electric chair does not work,

Someone has stolen all the nails from the bed😛

and the Indian devil is a former government servant,

So he just comes, signs the attendance register and then goes to the canteen..!"

Once he received a call from old age home....Mom very serious ..... please come to visit.

Son went and saw mom very critical, on her dying bed.

He asked: Mom what can I do for you.

Mom replied... "Please install fans in the old age home, there are none.... Also put a fridge for betterment of food because many times I slept without food".

Son was surprised and asked: mom, while you were here you never complained, now you have few hours left and you are telling me all this, why?

Mom replied....."it's OK dear, I've managed with the heat, hunger & pain, but when your children will send you here, I am afraid you will not be able to manage

03/11/14, 10:04 PM - natarajan ramu: நாட்டை ஆண்டுகொண்டிருந்த மன்னருக்குத் திடீரென ஒரு சந்தேகம் உதித்தது. உடனடியாக அமைச்சரை வரவழைத்தார்.

“நான் இந்த நாட்டை இவ்வளவு நன்றாகவும், புத்திசாலித்தனத்துடனும் ஆண்டு வருகிறேன், ஆனால் இந்த நாட்டிலும் முட்டாள்கள் இருப்பார்கள் அல்லவா?”

“ஆம் மன்னா!”

“அப்படியானால் அவர்களில் முதல் ஐந்து முட்டாள்கள் யார்?? அவர்களைத் தேடிக் கண்டுபிடித்துக் கூட்டிக் கொண்டு வருவது உம் பொறுப்பு” என்றார்.

அமைச்சருக்கு ஒன்றுமே புரியவில்லை, புத்திசாலியைக் கொண்டு வரச் சொன்னால் ஏதாவது போட்டி வைத்து வெற்றியாளரைக் கொண்டு வரலாம். முட்டாளைக் கொண்டு வரச் சொன்னால்?? என்ன செய்வது சொன்னது மன்னராயிற்றே, “சரி மன்னா” என்று ஒத்துக் கொண்டார்.

ஒரு மாதம் நாடு முழுவதும் பயணம் செய்து இரண்டுபேரை மட்டும் கூட்டிக்கொண்டு வந்தார். அதைப் பார்த்ததும் மன்னர், “அமைச்சரே உமக்குக் கணிதம் மறந்து விட்டதோ??”

“இல்லை மன்னா! முதலில் நடந்ததை விளக்க அனுமதிக்க வேண்டும்!” என்றார் அமைச்சர்.

“தொடரும்” என்றார் மன்னர்.

“மன்னா! நான் நாடு முழுவதும் சுற்றும்போது, இவன் மாட்டு வண்டியின்மேல் அமர்ந்துகொண்டு தன் துணி மூட்டையைத் தலைமேல் வைத்து, பயணம் செய்து கொண்டிருந்தான், ஏன் அவ்வாறு செய்கிறாய்? எனக் கேட்டதற்கு என்னைச் சுமந்து செல்லும் மாடுகளுக்கு வலிக்கக்கூடாதல்லவா? அதற்குத்தான் என்றான் – இவன்தான் நம் நாட்டின் ஐந்தாவது மிகப் பெரிய முட்டாள்.”’ என்றார் அமைச்சர்.

“சரி அடுத்து”

“இதோ இவன் தன் வீட்டுக் கூரைமேல் வளர்ந்த புல்லை மேய்க்க, எருமையைக் கூரைமேல் இழுத்துக் கொண்டிருந்தான், இவன்தான் நம் நாட்டின் நான்காவது மிகப் பெரிய முட்டாள்”

“களிப்படைந்தோம் அமைச்சரே! களிப்படைந்தோம்! சரி, எங்கே அடுத்த முட்டாள்?”

“அரசவையில் தீர்க்கப்பட வேண்டிய பிரச்சினைகள் எவ்வளவோ இருக்கும்போது, அதையெல்லாம் விட்டுவிட்டு முட்டாள்களைத் தேடி, கடந்த ஒரு மாதமாய் அலைந்துகொண்டிருந்த நான்தான் மூன்றாவது முட்டாள்.”

மன்னருக்குச் சிரிப்பு தாங்கவில்லை, விழுந்து விழுந்து சிரித்தார். பின்னர் “அடுத்தது” என்றார்.

””நாட்டில் எவ்வளவோ பிரச்சினைகள் இருக்கும்போது அதைக் கவனிக்காமல் முட்டாள்களைத் தேடிக் கொண்டிருக்கும் நீங்கள்தான் இரண்டாவது” என்றார் அமைச்சர்.

ஒரு நிமிடம் அரசவையே ஆடிவிட்டது. யாரும் எதுவும் பேசவில்லை.

“உமது கருத்திலும் நியாயம் உள்ளது. நான் செய்ததும் தவறுதான்” என ஒத்துக் கொண்டார் மன்னர்.

“சரி எங்கே முதலாவது முட்டாள்?”

அமைச்சர் சொன்னார்.”மன்னா! அலுவலகத்திலும், வீட்டிலும் எவ்வளவோ வேலைகள் இருந்தாலும் அதையெல்லாம் விட்டுவிட்டு whatsapp thaan குடியென வாழ்ந்து இந்த மொக்கையான கதைக்கு வந்து நாட்டின் மிகப் பெரிய முட்டாள் யாரென்று தேடிக் படித்துகொண்டிருக்கிறாரே இவர்தான் அந்த முதல் முட்டாள்!”

#ஆத்தீ , கடைசியில் நம்மளையே முட்டாளாக்கிட்டாங்களே!!

05/11/14, 9:02 AM - natarajan ramu: The concept of ICE !!!! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

We all carry our mobile phones with names & numbers stored in its memory but nobody, other than ourselves, knows which of these numbers belong to our closest family or friends. 

If we were to be involved in an accident or were taken ill, the people attending us would have our mobile phone but wouldn't know who to call. Yes, there are hundreds of numbers stored but which one is the contact person in case of an emergency? Hence this "ICE" (In Case of Emergency) Campaign 

The concept of "ICE" is catching on quickly. It is a method of contact during emergency situations. As cell phones are carried by the majority of the population, all you need to do is store the number of a contact person or persons who should be contacted during emergency under the name "ICE" ( In Case Of Emergency). 

The idea was thought up by a paramedic who found that when he went to the scenes of accidents, there were always mobile phones with patients, but they didn't know which number to call. He therefore thought that it would be a good idea if there was a nationally recognized name for this purpose. In an emergency situation, Emergency Service personnel and hospital Staff would be able to quickly contact the right person by simply dialing the number you have stored as "ICE." 

For more than one contact name simply enter ICE1, ICE2 and ICE3 etc. A great idea that will make a difference! 

Let's spread the concept of ICE by storing an ICE number in our Mobile phones today! 
🔻
e.g.
Name  ICE Surinder Goyal
No.       +91XXXXXXXXXX
🔺
Please forward this. It won't take too many "forwards" before everybody will know about this It really could save your life, or put a loved one's mind at rest, Please send this to your near & dear one. 

Remember:- 
ICE will speak for you when you are not able to....

14/11/14, 6:24 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: When I was small :-

• I'd put my arms in my
shirt and told people
I lost my arms 

• Would restart the video
game whenever I knew I was going to lose

• Had that one pen with
four colors, and tried to push all the buttons at once

• Waited behind a door to
scare someone, then leaving because they're taking too long to come out.

• Faked being asleep,so I
could be carried to bed.

• Used to think that the moon followed our car

• Tried to balance the switch between On/Off

• Watching two drops of
rain roll down window and pretending it was a race

• The only thing i had to
take care of was a school bag.

• Swallowed a fruit seed I
was scared to death that a tree was going to grow in my tummy.

• Closed the fridge
extremely slowly to see
when the lights went off.

• Walked into a room,. forgot what you needed, Walked out, and then remember.

Remember when we were
kids and couldn't wait to grow up? and now we think why did we even grow up?

18/11/14, 3:31 PM - Pornima Akka: Murphy drops some buttered toast on the kitchen floor and it lands butter-side-up.
 
He looks down in astonishment, for he knows that it's a law of nature of the universe that buttered toast always falls butter-down.
 
So he rushes round to the presbytery to fetch Father Flanagan.
 
He tells the priest that a miracle has occurred in his kitchen.
 
But he won't say what it is, so he asks Fr. Flanagan to come and see it with his own eyes.
 
He leads Fr. Flanagan into the kitchen and asks him what he sees on the floor.
 
"Well," says the priest, "it's pretty obvious. Someone has dropped some buttered toast on the floor and then, for some reason, they flipped it over so that the butter was on top."
 
"No, Father, I dropped it and it landed like that!" exclaimed Murphy
 
"Oh my Lord," says Fr. Flanagan, "dropped toast never falls with the butter side up. It's a mir….
 
Wait... it's not for me to say it's a miracle. I'll have to report this matter to the Bishop and he'll have to deal with it. He'll send some people round; to interview you, take photos, etc."
 
A thorough investigation is conducted, not only by the archdiocese but by scientists sent over from the Curia in Rome. No expense is spared. There is great excitement in the town as everyone knows that a miracle will bring in much need tourism revenue.
 
Then, after 8 long weeks and with great fanfare, the Bishop announces the final ruling.
 
"It is certain that some kind of an extraordinary event took place in Murphy's kitchen, quite outside the natural laws of the universe. Yet the Holy See must be very cautious before ruling a miracle. All other explanations must be ruled out.
 
Unfortunately, in this case, it has been declared 'No Miracle' because they think that Murphy may have buttered the toast on the wrong side!"

20/11/14, 10:27 PM - natarajan ramu: Neeta Ambani recently wore a saree to an event costing Rs. 40 Crore. Name of the saree is 'Vivaah Patu' sari, it features the reproduction of 11 paintings by Indian art icon Raja Ravi Varma. The embroidery is made from real gold threads and uses Navratna stones like like diamond, emerald, ruby, yellow sapphire, sapphire, topaz, pearl, cat's eye and coral.
The sari was hand woven using double warp by 36 handloom workers at Chennai Silks mill in Kancheepuram. It weighs 8kg and was completed in 12 months and has entered in Guinness book of world record as the world's costliest saree.

22/11/14, 7:47 AM - Paiya perrippa: Once there was a bus conductor, who was very rude to his passengers.

One day a beautiful young girl, of around 18 years,tried to board thebb bus, but he didn't stop the bus.

Unfortunately the beautiful young girl came under the bus and died on the spot. Angry passengers took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to the court.

The judge was not at all impressed with him and gave him capital punishment.

He was taken to the electrocution chamber. There was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. The conductor was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him. But to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession.

After a few months, this time, a good looking middle aged woman tried to board the bus but the conductor didn't stop the bus. Unfortunately, this time also, the good looking middle aged woman came under the bus and died on the spot.

Again angry passengers took him to the police station, who in turn took him to the court. The judge took one look at the conductor and gave him capital punishment. The Bus conductor was taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him. This time also, to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession.

A couple of months later, an elderly gentleman tried to board the bus.

This time the Bus conductor, remembering his earlier experiences, stopped the bus. Unfortunately the elderly gentleman slipped and died due to his
injuries. The conductor was taken to the police station and then to the court, to the same judge. Though he hadn't done anything wrong, but considering his past record the judge decided to set an example and gave him capital punishment.

The Bus conductor was again taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him.

This time he died instantly !!!!!!!!!!!

The question is why didn't he die on the first two occasions, but died instantly the third time??

Try to solve it yourselves. This is rather interesting and answer is perfectly logical. If necessary read the puzzle once again.

Still couldn't? Then see below.........

Think hard

Common.............

Tired....?

Wanna know the answer????

Okay........ here is the Answer............

During the first two times, the conductor was a Bad Conductor, therefore electricity didn't pass through him. But during the third time, he was a good conductor, so electricity passed through him freely and he died !!!! Physics never go wrong....

Note:-

Don't look  at me!! I am also looking for the Person😂 who sent me this...😜

26/11/14, 1:12 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: A joker told the audience a wonderful joke and all the people started laughing...

Joker repeated the same joke and only few people laughed..

He again repeated the same joke but this time no one laughed...😐😐

Then he told these beautiful lines...;

" when you cannot laugh on the same joke again and again...
then why do you cry  again and again on the same worry"

So enjoy your every moment of life..!!
Life is beautiful
Today is Charlie Chaplin's 125th birthday - a good day to recollect his 3 heart-touching statements:-

(1) Nothing is permanent in this world, not even our troubles.

(2) I like walking in the rain, because nobody can see my tears.

(3) The most wasted day in life is the day in which we have not laughed.

Keep smiling and pass this message to everyone whom you want to see smiling too.😀😀😀

06/12/14, 1:57 PM - natarajan ramu: Although Gramophone was invented by Emile Berliner it was put to commercial use by Thomas Alva Edison in the 19th century. Edison, who had invented many other gadgets like electric light and the motion picture camera, had become a legend even in his own time. 

When he wanted to propagate the use of gramophone records, which could record human voice for posterity, he wanted to record the voice of an eminent scholar on his first piece. For that he chose Prof. Max Muller of Germany, another great personality of the 19th century. He wrote to Max Muller saying, "I want to meet you and record your voice. When should I come?"

Max Muller, who had great respect for Edison, had asked him to come on a suitable time when most of the scholars of the Europe would be gathering in England. 

Accordingly, Edison took a ship and went to England. He was introduced to the audience. All cheered Edison’s presence. Later at the request of Edison, Max Muller came on the stage and spoke in front of the instrument. Then Edison went back to his laboratory and by afternoon came back with a disc. He played the gramophone disc from his instrument. The audience was thrilled to hear the voice of Max Muller from the instrument. They were glad that voices of great persons like Max Muller could be stored for the benefit of posterity.

After several rounds of applause and congratulations to Thomas Alva Edison, Max Muller came to the stage and addressed the scholars and asked them, "You heard my original voice in the morning. Then you heard the same voice coming out from this instrument in the afternoon. Did you understand what I said in the morning or what you heard this afternoon?" 

The audience fell silent because they could not understand the language in which Max Muller had spoken. It was `Greek and Latin' to them as they say. But had it been Greek or Latin, they would have definitely understood because they were from various parts of Europe. It was in a language which the European scholars had never heard. 

Max Muller then explained what he had spoken. He said that the language he spoke was Sanskrit and it was the first sloka of Rig Veda, which says "Agni Meele Purohitam." This was the first recorded public version on the gramophone plate.

Why did Max Muller choose this? Addressing the audience he said, "Vedas are the oldest text of the human race. And “Agni Meele Purohitam” is the first verse of Rig Veda. In the most primordial time, when people in many continents did not even know how to cover their bodies and lived by hunting and lived in caves, Indians had attained high civilization and they gave the world universal philosophies in the form of the Vedas.”

When “Agni Meele Purohitam” was replayed the entire audience stood up in silence as a mark of respect for the ancient Hindu sages.

This verse means:

"Oh Agni, You who gleam in the darkness, To You we come day-by-day, with devotion and bearing homage. So be of easy access to us, Agni, as a father to his son, abide with us for our well being".

07/12/14, 1:19 PM - Paiya perrippa: Bill Gates has decided not to invest further on computers after receiving a letter📃 from Mr. Captain vijayakanth.

To,
Bill Gates,
Microsoft,
U.S.A.

From:Captain Vijayakanth

Date: 1 April 2014

Subject: Problems with my new computer...💻

Dear Mr. Bill Gates,
We have bought a computer for our home & we have found some problems, which I want to bring to your notice.


1. There is a button 'start' but there is no 'stop' button.
We request you to check this.😳

2. One doubt is whether any 're-scooter' is available in system?
I find only 're-cycle',
but I own a scooter.🚲😒

3. There is 'Find' button but it is not working.
My wife lost the door key & we tried a lot to trace the key with this 'find' button, but was unable to trace.
Please rectify this problem.🚪🔑

4. My child learned😅 'Microsoft word' & now he wants to learn 'Microsoft sentence',
so when you will provide that?👶😮

5. I bought computer,
CPU, mouse &  keyboard,but there is only one icon which shows 'My Computer': when will you provide me the remaining items?😬

6. It is surprising that windows says 'My Pictures' but there is not even a single photo of mine. So when will you keep my photo in that.😶

7. There is 'MICROSOFT OFFICE' what about 'MICROSOFT HOME' since I use the PC at home.🏡

8. You provided 'My Recent Documents'.
When you will provide 'My Past Documents'? 🔫

9. You provide 'My Network Places'.
For God sake please do not provide 'My Secret Places'.

Last one Mr. Bill Gates

P.S: "Sir, how is it that your name is Gates but you are selling WINDOWS ?"🔨💉😲

Regards,

VIJAYAKANTH..🔨😱😹
07/12/14, 9:28 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: During a recent robbery in Hong Kong, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: 
"Don't move. The money belongs to the Government. Your life belongs to you."

Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. 

This is called "Mind Changing Concept” Changing the conventional way of thinking.

When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her:
"Please be civilised! This is a robbery and not a rape!" 

This is called "Being Professional” 
Focus only on what you are trained to do! 

When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school):
"Big brother, let's count how much we got."

The older robber rebutted and said:
"You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!" 


This is called "Experience” 
Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! 

After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: 
"Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”.

This is called "Swim with the tide” 
Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage!

The supervisor says: "It will be good if there is a robbery every month."  

This is called "Changing priority” 
Personal Happiness is more important than your job”.

The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. 


The robbers were very angry and complained:
"We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!" 


This is called "Knowledge is worth as much as gold!"

Hanuman Chalisa and Gayatri Mantra 


Any one who knows the Hanuman Chalisa? In Hanuman Chalisa, it is said : 

"Yug sahastra yojan per Bhanu! 
Leelyo taahi madhur phal janu!! 

1 Yug = 12000 years 
1 Sahastra = 1000 

1 Yojan = 8 Miles 

Yug x Sahastra x Yojan = par Bhanu 
12000 x 1000 x 8 miles = 96000000 miles 

1 mile = 1.6kms 

96000000 miles = 96000000 x 1.6kms = 
96000000 miles/1536000000 kms to Sun 

NASA has said that, it is the exact distance between Earth and Sun (Bhanu). 
Which proves God Hanuman did jump to Planet Sun, thinking it as a sweet fruit (Madhur phal). 

It is really interesting how accurate and meaningful our ancient scriptures are.Unfortunately barely it is recognized, interpreted accurately or realized by any in today's time... 

The GAYATRI MANTRA" the most powerful hymn in the world 

Dr.Howard Steingeril, an American scientist, collected Mantras, Hymns and invocations from all over the world and tested for their strength in his Physiology Laboratory& 

Hindu's Gayatri Mantra produced 110,000 sound waves /second... 

This was the highest and was found to be the most powerful hymn in the world. 
Through the combination of sound or sound waves of a particular frequency, this Mantra is claimed to be capable of developing specific spiritual potentialities. 
The Hamburg university initiated research in 
to the efficacy of the Gayatri Mantra both on the mental and physical plane of CREATION... 

The GAYATRI MANTRA is broadcasted daily for 15 minutes from 7 P.M. onwards over Radio Paramaribo, Surinam, South America for the past two years, and in Amsterdam, Holland for the last six months. 

"Om Bhoor Bhuwah Swah, Tat Savitur Varenyam, Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi, Dhiyo Yo Nah Pra-chodayaat !" 😊

"It's meaning: 

God is dear to me like my own breath, He is the dispeller of my pains, and giver of happiness.I meditate on the supremely adorable Light of the Divine Creator, that it may inspire . thought and understanding." 

The above information is worth circulating and sharing with one and all! How rich and wonderful are our Vedas.

16/12/14, 10:35 AM - natarajan ramu: கண்ணன் ஏன் பாண்டவர்களை காப்பாற்றவில்லை?
(கண்ணனின் அற்புத விளக்கம்)
***************************
பகவான் கிருஷ்ணனின் குழந்தைப் பருவம் முதலே, அவருக்குப் பணிவிடைகள் செய்து, தேரோட்டி, பல்வேறு சேவைகள் புரிந்தவர், உத்தவர்.

இவர் தனது வாழ்நாளில், தனக்கென நன்மைகளோ வரங்களோ கண்ணனிடம் கேட்டதில்லை.

துவாபர யுகத்தில், தமது அவதாரப் பணியை முடித்துவிட்ட நிலையில், உத்தவரிடம் ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணர், ''உத்தவரே, இந்த அவதாரத்தில் பலர் என்னிடம் பல வரங்களும், நன்மைகளும் பெற்றிருக்கின்றனர். ஆனால், நீங்கள் எதுவுமே கேட்டதில்லை.

ஏதாவது கேளுங்கள், தருகிறேன். உங்களுக்கும் ஏதாவது நன்மைகள் செய்துவிட்டே, எனது அவதாரப் பணியை முடிக்க நினைக்கிறேன்'' என்றார்.

தனக்கென எதையும் கேட்காவிட்டாலும், சிறு வயது முதலே கண்ணனின் செயல்களைக் கவனித்து வந்த உத்தவருக்கு... சொல் ஒன்றும், செயல் ஒன்றுமாக இருந்த கண்ணனின் லீலைகள், புரியாத புதிராக இருந்தன. அவற்றுக்கான காரண, காரியங்களைத் தெரிந்துகொள்ள விரும்பினார்.

''பெருமானே! நீ வாழச் சொன்ன வழி வேறு; நீ வாழ்ந்து காட்டிய வழி வேறு! நீ நடத்திய மகாபாரத நாடகத்தில்... நீ ஏற்ற பாத்திரத்தில்,
நீ புரிந்த செயல்களில், எனக்குப் புரியாத விஷயங்கள் பல உண்டு. அவற்றுக்கெல்லாம் காரணங்களை அறிய ஆவலாக இருக்கிறேன். நிறைவேற்றுவாயா?'' என்றார் உத்தவர்.

''உத்தவரே! அன்று குருக்ஷேத்திரப் போரில் அர்ஜுனனுக்காக நான் சொன்னது, 'பகவத் கீதை’. இன்று உங்களுக்குத் தரும் பதில்கள், 'உத்தவ கீதை’. அதற்காகவே உங்களுக்கு இந்தச் சந்தர்ப்பத்தைத் தந்தேன். தயங்காமல் கேளுங்கள்'' என்றான் பரந்தாமன்.

உத்தவர் கேட்க ஆரம்பித்தார்: ''கண்ணா! முதலில் எனக்கு ஒரு விளக்கம் வேண்டும். உண்மையான நண்பன் யார்?''

''நண்பனுக்கு ஏற்படும் துயரத்தைத் தீர்க்க, உடனே அழைப்பு இல்லா மலேயே வந்து உதவி செய்பவனே உற்ற நண்பன்'' என்றான் கண்ணன்

.
''கிருஷ்ணா! நீ பாண்டவர்களின் உற்ற நண்பன். உன்னை அவர்கள் ஆபத்பாந்தவனாக, பரிபூரணமாக நம்பினார்கள்.

நடப்பதை மட்டுமல்ல; நடக்கப் போவதையும் நன்கறிந்த ஞானியான நீ... 'உற்ற நண்பன் யார்’ என்பதற்கு நீ அளித்த விளக்கத்தின்படி... முன்னதாகவே சென்று, 'தருமா! வேண்டாம் இந்தச் சூதாட்டம்’ என்று தடுத்திருக்கலாம் அல்லவா? ஏன் அப்படிச் செய்யவில்லை? போகட்டும்.

விளையாட ஆரம்பித்ததும், தருமன் பக்கம் அதிர்ஷ்டம் இருக்கும்படி செய்து, வஞ்சகர்களுக்கு நீதி புகட்டியிருக்கலாம்.

அதையும் நீ செய்யவில்லை. தருமன் செல்வத்தை இழந்தான்; நாட்டை இழந்தான்; தன்னையும் இழந்தான். சூதாடியதற்குத் தண்டனையாக, அதோடு அவனை விட்டிருக்கலாம்.

தம்பி களை அவன் பணயம் வைத்த போதாவது, நீ சபைக்குள் நுழைந்து தடுத்திருக்கலாம். அதையும் நீ செய்யவில்லை. 'திரௌபதி அதிர்ஷ்டம் மிக்கவள். அவளைப் பணயம் வைத்து ஆடு. இழந்தது அனைத்தையும் திருப்பித் தருகிறேன்’ என்று சவால் விட்டான் துரியோதனன்.

அப்போதாவது, உனது தெய்வீக சக்தியால், அந்தப் பொய்யான பகடைக் காய்கள் தருமனுக்குச் சாதகமாக விழும்படி செய்திருக்கலாம். அதையும் செய்யவில்லை.

மாறாக, திரௌபதியின் துகிலை உரித்து, அவளின் மானம் பறிபோகும் நிலை ஏற்பட்ட போதுதான் சென்று, 'துகில் தந்தேன், திரௌபதி மானம் காத்தேன்’ என்று மார்தட்டிக் கொண்டாய்.

மாற்றான் ஒருவன், குலமகள் சிகையைப் பிடித்து இழுத்து வந்து, சூதர் சபையில் பலர் முன்னிலையில், அவள் ஆடையில் கை வைத்த பிறகு,
எஞ்சிய மானம் என்ன இருக்கிறது? எதனைக் காத்ததாக நீ பெருமைப்படுகிறாய்?

ஆபத்தில் உதவுபவன்தானே ஆபத் பாந்தவன்? இந்த நிலையில் உதவாத நீயா ஆபத்பாந்தவன்? நீ செய்தது தருமமா?'' என்று கண்ணீர் மல்கக் கேட்டார் உத்தவர்.

இது உத்தவரின் உள்ளக் குமுறல் மட்டுமன்று; மகாபாரதம் படித்துவிட்டு நாம் அனைவருமே கேட்கும் கேள்விகளே இவை. நமக்காக இவற்றை அன்றே கண்ணனிடம் கேட்டிருக்கிறார் உத்தவர்.

பகவான் சிரித்தார். ''உத்தவரே... விவேகம் உள்ளவனே ஜெயிக்க வேண்டும் என்பது உலக தர்ம நியதி. துரியோதனனுக்கு இருந்த விவேகம் தருமனுக்கு இல்லை. அதனால்தான் தருமன் தோற்றான்'' என்றான் கண்ணன்.

உத்தவர் ஏதும் புரியாது திகைத்து நிற்க, கண்ணன் தொடர்ந்தான்:

''துரியோ தனனுக்கு சூதாடத் தெரியாது. ஆனால், பணயம் வைக்க அவனிடம் பணமும், ஏராளமான ஆஸ்தியும் இருந்தது. 'பணயம் நான் வைக்கிறேன். என் மாமா சகுனி, பகடையை உருட்டிச் சூதாடுவார்’ என்றான் துரியோதனன்.

அது விவேகம். தருமனும் அதுபோலவே விவேகத்துடன் செயல்பட்டு, 'நானும் பணயம் வைக்கிறேன். ஆனால், என் சார்பாக என் மைத்துனன் ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணன் பகடைக்காயை உருட்டுவான்'' என்று சொல்லியிருக்கலாமே?

சகுனியும் நானும் சூதாடியிருந்தால், யார் ஜெயித்திருப்பார்கள்? நான் கேட்கும் எண்ணிக்கைகளைச் சகுனியால் பகடைக் காய்களில் போடத்தான் முடியுமா? அல்லது, அவன் கேட்கும் எண்ணிக்கைளை என்னால்தான் போட முடியாதா? போகட்டும்.

தருமன் என்னை ஆட்டத்தில் சேர்த்துக் கொள்ள மறந்துவிட்டான் என்பதையாவது 
மன்னித்த விடலாம். ஆனால், அவன் விவேகமில்லாமல் மற்றொரு மாபெரும் தவற்றையும் செய்தான்.

'ஐயோ... விதிவசத் தால் சூதாட ஒப்புக்கொண்டேனே! ஆனால், இந்த விஷயம் ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணனுக்கு மட்டும் தெரியவே கூடாது. கடவுளே! அவன் மட்டும் சூதாட்ட மண்டபத்துக்கு வராமல் இருக்க வேண்டும்’ என்று வேண்டிக் கொண்டான்;

என்னை மண்டபத்துக்குள் வர முடியாத வாறு, அவனே கட்டிப் போட்டுவிட்டான். நான் அங்கு வரக்கூடாதென என்னிடமே வேண்டிக்கொண்டான்.

யாராவது தனது பிரார்த்தனையால் என்னைக் கூப்பிட மாட்டார்களா என்று மண்டபத்துக்கு வெளியில் காத்துக்கொண்டு நின்றேன்.

பீமனையும், அர்ஜுனனையும், நகுல- சகாதேவர்களையும் வைத்து இழந்தபோது, அவர்களும் துரியோதனனைத் திட்டிக் கொண்டும், தங்கள் கதியை எண்ணி நொந்து கொண்டும் இருந்தார்களே தவிர, என்னைக் கூப்பிட மறந்துவிட்டார்களே!

அண்ணன் ஆணையை நிறைவேற்ற துச்சாதனன் சென்று, திரௌபதியின் சிகையைப் பிடித்தபோது, அவளாவது என்னைக் கூப்பிட்டாளா? இல்லை.

அவளும் தனது பலத்தையே நம்பி, சபையில் வந்து, வாதங்கள் செய்து கொண்டிருந்தாளே ஒழிய, என்னைக் கூப்பிடவில்லை! நல்லவேளை..

. துச்சாதனன் துகிலுரித்தபோதும் தனது பலத்தால் போராடாமல், 'ஹரி... ஹரி... அபயம் கிருஷ்ணா... அபயம்’ எனக் குரல் கொடுத்தாள் பாஞ்சாலி. அவளுடைய மானத்தைக் காப்பாற்ற அப்போதுதான் எனக்குச் சந்தர்ப்பம் கிடைத்தது.

அழைத்ததும் சென்றேன். அவள் மானத்தைக் காக்க வழி செய்தேன். இந்தச் சம்பவத்தில் என் மீது என்ன தவறு?'' என்று பதிலளித்தான் கண்ணன்.

''அருமையான விளக்கம்
கண்ணா! அசந்துவிட்டேன். ஆனால், ஏமாறவில்லை. உன்னை இன்னொரு கேள்வி கேட்கலாமா?'' என்றார் உத்தவர். ''கேள்'' என்றான் கண்ணன்.

''அப்படியானால், கூப்பிட்டால்தான் நீ வருவாயா? நீயாக, நீதியை நிலை நாட்ட, ஆபத்துகளில் உன் அடியவர் களுக்கு உதவ வரமாட்டாயா?''
புன்னகைத்தான் கண்ணன்

. ''உத்தவா, மனித வாழ்க்கை அவரவர் கர்ம வினைப்படி அமைகிறது. நான் அதை நடத்து வதும் இல்லை; அதில் குறுக்கிடுவதும் இல்லை. நான் வெறும் 'சாட்சி பூதம்’. நடப்பதையெல்லாம் அருகில் நின்று பார்த்துக்கொண்டு நிற்பவனே! அதுதான் தெய்வ தர்மம்'' என்றான்.

''நன்றாயிருக்கிறது கிருஷ்ணா! அப்படியானால், நீ அருகில் நின்று, நாங்கள் செய்யும் தீமைகளையெல்லாம் பார்த்துக் கொண்டிருப்பாய். நாங்கள் தவறுகளைத் தொடர்ந்து செய்து கொண்டேயிருந்து பாவங்களைக் குவித்து, துன்பங்களை அனுபவித்துக் கொண்டே இருக்க வேண்டும். அப்படித்தானே?'' என்றார் உத்தவர்.

''உத்தவரே! நான் சொன்ன வாசகங்களின் உட்பொருளை நன்றாக உணர்ந்து பாருங்கள். நான் சாட்சி பூதமாக அருகில் நிற்பதை நீங்கள் உணரும் போது, உங்களால் தவறுகளையோ தீவினை களையோ நிச்சயமாகச் செய்ய முடியாது.

அதை நீங்கள் மறந்துவிடும்போதுதான், எனக்குத் தெரியாமல் செயல்களைச் செய்துவிடலாம் என்று எண்ணுகிறீர்கள்.

பாதிப்புக்கு உள்ளாக்கும் சம்பவங்கள் நிகழ்வதும் அப்போதுதான். எனக்குத் தெரியாமல் சூதாடலாம் என்று தருமன் நினைத்தானே, அதுதான் அவனது அஞ்ஞானம்.

நான் சாட்சி பூதமாக எப்போதும், எல்லோருடனும் இருப்பவன் என்பதை தருமன் உணர்ந்திருந்தால், இந்த சூதாட்ட நிகழ்ச்சி வேறு விதமாக
முடிந்திருக்கும் அல்லவா?'' என்றான் ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணன்.

உத்தவர் வாயடைத்து, பக்திப் பரவசத்தில் ஆழ்ந்தார். ஆகா... எத்தனை ஆழமான தத்துவம்! எத்தனை உயர்ந்த சத்யம்!

பகவானைப் பூஜிப்பதும், பிரார்த்தனை செய்வதும், அவனை உதவிக்கு அழைக்கும் ஓர் உணர்வுதானே! 'அவனின்றி ஓர் அணுவும் அசையாது’ என்ற நம்பிக்கை வரும்போது, அவன் சாட்சி பூதமாக அருகில் நிற்பதை எப்படி உணராமல் இருக்க முடியும்?

அதனை மறந்துவிட்டு எப்படிச் செயலாற்ற முடியும்? இந்த தத்துவத்தைதான் பகவத்கீதை முழுவதிலும் கண்ணன் அர்ஜுனனுக்கு உபதேசித்தான்.

அர்ஜுனனுக்காகத் தேரைச் செலுத்தி வழிநடத்தினானே தவிர, அர்ஜுனன் இடத்தில் தானே நின்று அவனுக்காகப் போராடவில்லை!

ஹரே கிருஷ்ணா👏

16/12/14, 10:35 AM - natarajan ramu: ஒரு சமயம் தேவேந்திரன்
தன்னை சனி பிடிக்கப் போகிறார்
என்பதை அறிந்து, சனியைக்
கூப்பிட்டு "நான்
தேவர்களுக்கெல்லாம் தலைவன்
என்னை எப்படி நீ பிடிக்கலாம்?''
என்று கேட்டார். அதற்கு சனி பகவான்
"என் பார்வையிலிருந்து எவருமே தப்ப
முடியாது'' எனப்பதிலளித்தார்.
"அப்படியானால் நீ என்னைப்பிடிக்கும்
நேரத்தைச் சொல்லி விடு''
என்று தேவேந்திரன் கேட்டார்.
சனி பகவானும் அதைக் கூறினார்.
அந்நேரம் வந்ததும் இந்திரன்
பெருச்சாளி உருவம்
எடுத்து சாக்கடையில்
ஒளிந்து கொண்டான்.
சனி அந்த இடத்தில் தேட மாட்டார்
என்று நினைத்தார். அவர்
நினைத்தப்படியே குறிப்பிட்ட நேரம்
கடந்தது. சனி பார்வை தன்
மீது படவில்லை என்று இந்திரன்
மகிழ்ந்தார். சிறிது நேரம் கழிந்ததும்
இந்திரன்
வெளியே வந்து சனி பகவானைக்
கூப்பிட்டு, தான் தப்பித்து விட்டதாக
பெருமையாக கூறினார்.
உடனே சனீஸ்வரன் சிரித்துக்
கொண்டே நீங்கள்
சிம்மாசனத்தை விட்டு சாக்கடையில்
சில நாழிகை இருந்ததே என்
பிடிப்பினால்தான் என்றார்.
எங்கு சென்று ஒளிந்து கொண்டாலும்
சனியின் பிடியில் இருந்து தப்ப
முடியாது என்பது இதன் மூலம்
தெளிவாகிறது.

Germany is a highly industrialized country. In such a country, many will think its people lead a luxurious life.

When we arrived at Hamburg , my colleagues walked into the restaurant, we noticed that a lot of tables were empty. There was a table where a young couple was having their meal. There were only two dishes and two cans of beer on the table. I wondered if such simple meal could be romantic, and whether the girl will leave this stingy guy.

There were a few old ladies on another table. When a dish is served, the waiter would distribute the food for them, and they would finish every bit of the food on their plates.

As we were hungry, our local colleague ordered more food for us.When we left, there was still about one third of un-consumed food on the table.

When we were leaving the restaurant, the old ladies spoke to us in English, we understood that they were unhappy about us wasting so much food.

"We paid for our food, it is none of your business how much food we left behind," my colleague told the old ladies. The old ladies were furious. One of them immediately took her hand phone out and made a call to someone. After a while, a man in uniform from Social Security organisation arrived. Upon knowing what the dispute was, he issued us a 50 Euro fine. We all kept quiet.

The officer told us in a stern voice, "ORDER WHAT YOU CAN CONSUME, MONEY IS YOURS BUT RESOURCES BELONG TO THE SOCIETY. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS IN THE WORLD WHO ARE FACING SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES. YOU HAVE NO REASON TO WASTE RESOURCES."

The mindset of people of this rich country put all of us to shame. WE REALLY NEED TO REFLECT ON THIS. We are from country which is not very rich in resources. To save face, we order large quantity and also waste food when we give others a treat.
(Courtesy: A friend who is now changed a lot)

THE LESSON IS:- THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT CHANGING OUR BAD HABITS. 
VERY TRUE -"MONEY IS YOURS BUT RESOURCES BELONG TO THE SOCIETY."

27/12/14, 11:44 AM - natarajan ramu: அறிவியல் உண்மை ( ஆன்மீகம் )

முற்காலத்தில் ஊரில் கோயில் கோபுரத்தை விட உயரமாக எந்தக் கட்டிடமும் இருக்கக் கூடாது என்று ஒரு எழுதாத சட்டம் இருந்தது. என்ன காரணம்?!

கோயில்களையும் உயரமான கோபுரங்களையும் அதன் மேல் இருக்கும் கலசங்களையும் பார்த்திருப்பீர்கள். 

அதன் பின் ஒளிந்திருக்கும் ஆன்மிக உண்மை தெரியவில்லை. ஆனால் அதன் பின் எவ்வளவு பெரிய அறிவியல் ஒளிந்திருக்கிறது என இப்போதுதான் தெரிகிறது.

கோபுரத்தின் உச்சியில் தங்கம், வெள்ளி செம்பு(அ) ஐம்பொன்னால் செய்யப்பட்ட கலசங்கள் இருக்கும். 

இக்கலசங்களிலும் அதில் கொட்டப்படும் தானியங்களும், உலோகங்களும் மின் காந்த அலைகளை ஈர்க்கும் சக்தியை கலசங்களுக்குக் கொடுக்கின்றன.

நெல், உப்பு, கேழ்வரகு, தினை, வரகு, சோளம், மக்கா சோளம், சலமை, எள் ஆகியவற்றைக் கொட்டினார்கள். 

குறிப்பாக வரகு தானியத்தை அதிகமாகக் கொட்டினார்கள். 

காரணத்தைத் தேடிப் பார்த்தால் ஆச்சர்யமாக இருக்கிறது. 

வரகு மின்னலைத் தாங்கும் அதிக ஆற்றலைப் பெற்றிருப்பது என இப்போதைய அறிவியல் கூறுகிறது.

இவ்வளவுதானா? 

இல்லை, 

பன்னிரெண்டு வருடங்களுக்கு ஒரு முறை குடமுழுக்கு விழா என்ற பெயரில் கலசங்களில் இருக்கும் பழைய தானியங்கள் நீக்கப்பட்டு புதிய தானியங்கள் நிரப்பப்படுகிறது. 

அதை இன்றைக்கு சம்பிரதாயமாகவே மட்டும் கடைபிடிக்கிறார்கள். 

காரணத்தைத் தேடினால், அந்த தானியங்களுக்குப் பன்னிரெண்டு வருடங்களுக்குத்தான் அந்த
 சக்தி இருக்கிறது. 

அதன் பின் அது செயல் இழந்து விடுகிறது!! 

இதை எப்படி அப்போது அறிந்திருந்தார்கள்..?!

ஆச்சர்யம்தான். 

அவ்வளவுதானா அதுவும் இல்லை. இன்றைக்குப் பெய்வதைப் போன்று மூன்று நாட்களா மழை பெய்தது அன்று? 

தொடர்ந்து மூன்று மாதங்கள் பெய்தது. 

ஒரு வேளை தானியங்கள் அனைத்தும் நீரில் மூழ்கி அழிந்து போனால், மீண்டும் எதை வைத்துப் பயிர் செய்வது? 

இவ்வளவு உயரமான கோபுரத்தை நீர் சூழ வாய்ப்பில்லை. இதையே மீண்டும் எடுத்து விதைக்கலாமே!

ஒரு இடத்தில் எது மிக உயரமான இடத்தில் அமைந்த இடி தாங்கியோ அதுதான் முதலில் 'எர்த்' ஆகும். 

மேலும் அது எத்தனை பேரைக் காப்பாற்றும் என்பது அதன் உயரத்தைப் பொறுத்தது. அடிப்படையில் கலசங்கள் இடிதாங்கிகள். 

உதாரணமாக கோபுரத்தின் உயரம் ஐம்பது மீட்டர் என்றால் நூறு மீட்டர் விட்டம் வரைக்கும் பரப்பில் எத்தனை பேர் இருந்தாலும் அவர்கள் இடி தாங்காமல் காக்கப்படுவார்கள். 

அதாவது சுமார் 75008 மீட்டர் பரப்பளவிலிருக்கும் மனிதர்கள் காப்பாற்றப்படுவார்கள்!

சில கோயில்களுக்கு நான்கு வாயில்கள் உள்ளன. 

அது நாலாபுறமும் 75000சதுர
 மீட்டர் பரப்பளவைக் காத்து நிற்கிறது! 

இது ஒரு தோராயமான கணக்கு தான்.

இதைவிட உயரமான கோபுரங்கள் இதை விட அதிகமான பணிகளை சத்தமில்லாமல் செய்து வருகின்றன.

 "கோயில் இல்லா ஊரில் குடியிருக்க
 வேண்டாம்"

என்ற பழமொழி நினைவுக்கு வருகிறது..

படித்ததும் பகிரவும்!!!

30/12/14, 7:38 AM - Paiya perrippa: Chidambara Rahasyam (Secret ).    

After 8 years of R & D, Western scientists have proved that at Lord Nataraja 's big toe is the Centre Point of World 's Magnetic Equator. 

Our ancient Tamil Scholar Thirumoolar has proved this Five thousand years ago! His treatise
Thirumandiram is a wonderful Scientific guide for the whole world. 

To understand his studies, it may need a 100 years for us.

Chidambaram temple embodies the following  characteristics :

1)  This temple is located at the Center Point of world 's Magnetic Equator.

2) Of the "Pancha bootha" i.e. 5 temples, Chidambaram denotes the Skies.  Kalahasthi denotes Wind.  Kanchi Ekambareswar denotes land.  All these 3 temples are located in a straight line at 79 degrees 41 minutes Longitude. This can be verified using Google.  An amazing fact & astronomical miracle !

3)  Chidambaram temple is based on the Human Body having 9 Entrances denoting 9 Entrances or Openings of the body.

4) Temple roof is made of 21600 gold sheets which denotes the 21600 breaths taken by a human being every day (15 x 60 x 24 = 21600)

5) These 21600 gold sheets are fixed on the Gopuram using 72000 gold nails which denote the total no. of Nadis (Nerves) in the human body. These transfer energy to certain body parts that are invisible.

6)  Thirumoolar states that man represents the shape of Shivalingam, which represents Chidambaram which represents Sadashivam which represents HIS dance !

7) "Ponnambalam " is placed slightly tilted towards the left.  This represents our Heart.  To reach this, we need to climb 5 steps called "Panchatshara padi "
"Si, Va, Ya, Na, Ma " are the 5 Panchatshara mantras. 

There are 4 pillars holding the Kanagasabha representing the 4 Vedas.

8)  Ponnambalam has 28 pillars denoting the 28 "Ahamas "as well as the 28 methods to worship Lord Shiva.  These 28 pillars support 64 +64 Roof Beams which denote the 64 Arts.  The cross beams represent the Blood Vessels running across the Human body. 

9)  9 Kalasas on the Golden Roof represent the 9 types of Sakthi or Energies. 

The 6 pillars at the Artha Mantapa represent the 6 types of Sashtras.  

The 18 pillars in the adjacant Mantapa represents 18 Puranams.

10) The dance of Lord Nataraja is described as Cosmic Dance by Western Scientists.  

Whatever Science is propounding now has been stated by Hinduism thousands of years ago !
Hinduism is not a religion.its a way of living

10/01/15, 6:14 AM - Paiya perrippa: ஸ்ரீ ராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சருக்கும், சுவாமி விவேகானந்தருக்கும் நடைபெற்ற உரையாடல்...

உங்கள் பல சந்தேகங்களுக்கு இதில் தீர்வு ஒளிந்திருக்கக்கூடும். படியுங்கள்… மீண்டும் மீண்டும் படியுங்கள்… பல வரிகள் மிக மிக ஆழமான பரந்த பொருளை கொண்டவை.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : நாம் ஏன் எப்போதும் மகிழ்ச்சியில்லாமல் இருக்கிறோம்?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : துன்பத்தையே நினைத்து கற்பனை செய்துகொண்டிருப்பது உன் வழக்கமாகிவிட்டது. அதனால் உன்னால் மகிழ்ச்சியுடன் இருக்க முடியவில்லை.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : நல்லவர்களுக்கு மட்டும் எப்போதும் துன்பம் ஏன்?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : உரசாமல் வைரத்தை பட்டை தீட்டமுடியாது. நெருப்பிலிடாமல் தங்கத்தை தூய்மைப்படுத்த முடியாது. நல்லவர்கள் சோதனைக்குள்ளாவார்கள். ஆனால் அவர்கள் பாதிப்புக்குள்ளாகமாட்டார்கள். அந்த சோதனையின் மூலம் அவர்கள் மேன்மையடைவார்களே தவிர கீழே செல்ல மாட்டார்கள். (By experience their life becomes better, not bitter!)

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : அப்போது, சோதனைகள் நன்மைக்கு என்று சொல்கிறீர்களா?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : ஆம். அனுபவத்தை விட பெரிய ஆசிரியர் வேறு யாருமில்லை. அது முதலில் சோதனையை கொடுத்துவிட்டு பிறகு தான் பாடத்தை போதிக்கும்.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : கணக்கற்ற பிரச்னைகளில் மூழ்கி தவிப்பதால் நாங்கள் எங்கே போகிறோம் தெரியவில்லை….

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : வெளியே பார்த்தால் எங்கே போகிறோம் என்று உனக்கு புரியாது. உனக்குள்ளே பார். புரியும். கண்களால் பார்க்கத் தான் முடியும். ஆனால் உள்ளத்தால் தான் வழியை காட்ட முடியும். (Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.)

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : சரியான பாதையில் போகும்போதும் தோல்வி அடிக்கடி ஏற்படுகிறதே?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : செல்லும் பாதையில் வெற்றி என்பது பிறரால் அளக்கப்படுவது. ஆனால் அதில் கிடைக்கும் திருப்தி என்பது உன்னால் உன்னால் மட்டுமே உணரப்படுவது.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : கடினமான சூழ்நிலைகளில் எப்படி நீங்கள் உற்சாகம் குறையாமல் உத்வேகத்துடன் இருக்கிறீர்கள்?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : எப்பொழுதும், இனி எப்படி போகப்போகிறோம் என்று அச்சப்படுவதைவிட இதுவரை நீ எப்படி வந்திருக்கிறாய், எதையெல்லாம் கடந்து வந்திருக்கிறாய் என்று பார். உனக்கு கிடைத்த வரங்களை எண்ணிக்கொள். இழந்தவைகளை அல்ல.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : இந்த மக்களை நினைத்து நீங்கள் வியக்கும் விஷயம் எது?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : துன்பப்படும்போது “எனக்கு ஏன்? என்னை மட்டும் ஏன்??” என்று கேட்பவர்கள் இன்பத்தின் போது அந்த கேள்வியை கேட்பதில்லை. அதை நினைத்து தான் வியக்கிறேன்.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : வாழ்க்கையில் மிகச் சிறந்தவைகளை நான் அடைவது எப்படி?

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : உன் கடந்த காலத்தை வருத்தமின்றி ஏற்றுக்கொள். நிகழ்காலத்தை நம்பிக்கையோடு கைக்கொள். எதிர்காலத்தை அச்சமின்றி எதிர்நோக்கு. இதுவே வாழ்க்கையில் சிறந்தவைகளை பெற கடைபிடிக்கவேண்டிய நியதி.

❓சுவாமி விவேகானந்தர் : கடைசியாக ஒரே ஒரு கேள்வி. சில நேரங்களில் என்னுடைய பிரார்த்தனைகளை இறைவன் கேட்கவில்லையோ என்று தோன்றுகிறது.

✅இராமகிருஷ்ண பரமஹம்சர் : கேட்கப்படாத பிரார்த்தனைகள் என்று எதுவுமே இல்லை. (There are no unanswered prayers!) அச்சத்தை விடு. நம்பிக்கை கொள். வாழ்க்கை என்பது தீர்வு காணப்படவேண்டிய ஒரு புதிர் தானே தவிர பிரச்னை அல்ல. எப்படி வாழவேண்டும் என்று மட்டும் நாம் அறிந்து கொண்டால் வாழ்க்கை மிக மிக இனிமையாக மாறிவிடும். என்னை நம்பு

11/01/15, 5:41 PM - Paiya perrippa: It was a Sports Stadium...

8 boys were standing  on a track for racing.

Ready ! 

Steady !

Bang !

With sound of Pistol all boys started running.

Hardly  had they covered 10 to 15 steps,
1 boy slipped & fell.

 He started crying due to pain.

When other 7 Boys heard him, all of them STOPPED running..

STOOD for a while, 

turned BACK & RAN
towards him.

All the 7 Boys LIFTED the Boy,
pacified him,
joined hands together,
walked together &
reached WINNING Post.

Officials were shocked. 

Many Eyes were
filled with tears.

It happened sometime ago at Pune.

Race was conducted by
National Institute of
Mental Health...

All participants were
Mentally RETARDED.

What did they teach ?
Teamwork,
Humanity,
Sportsman spirit,
Love,
Care,
&
Equality..

We Surely can NEVER Do this,

because...

We have Brains.... 
We have Ego...
We have Attitude

26/01/15, 7:16 AM - Paiya perrippa: This is for all car owners. -Victim Mr.Arunkumar:

How to Lock Your Car and Why! 

"I locked my car. As I walked away I heard my car door unlock. I went back and locked my car again three times. Each time, as soon as I started to walk away, I could hear it unlock again!!

Naturally alarmed, I looked around and there were two men sitting in a car next to the Store. They were obviously watching me intently, and there seemed no doubt they were somehow involved in this very weird situation.

I quickly abandoned my errand, jumped into my car and sped away. I went straight to the police station, told them what had happened, and found out
I was part of a new, and very successful, scheme being used to gain entry into parked cars.

Two weeks later, my friend's son had a similar experience....While traveling, he stopped at a motorway service area to use the toilet. When he came out to his car less than 5 minutes later, someone had managed to get into his car and had stolen his mobile phone, laptop computer, sat-nav, briefcase and other belongings.

He called the police and since there were no signs of his car having been broken into, the police told him he had probably been a victim of the latest robbery tactic – there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your remote locking device.

They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim. They know you are going inside the Store, restaurant, or whatever and that they now
have a few minutes to steal and run.

The police officer said always to lock your car manually with the key when parking in a public area. That way if there is someone sitting in a car nearby watching for their next victim, it will not be you.

When you lock up with the key upon exiting, it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the remote button, it sends the code
through the airwaves where it can be easily intercepted by the device.

This is very real. Be aware of what you just read and please pass this information on...

Look how many times we all lock our doors with our remote just to be sure we remembered to lock them -- and bingo, someone has our code...and potentially whatever is in our car."

Please share with everyone you know in the hope that we can stop these thieves!

Dont use products from hindustan lever, 
Only name is hindustan it has been taken by foreign company

We blame politicians 

Now go and check the things you use and ask yourself how much do you contribute to the decreased value of RUPEE

You use these foreign made products... 
& 
Government have to pay in dollars for d same...thus value of rupee Decreases...
Aren't u responsible for fall of rupee..
In case Samsung S4 at Rs 41000. Same features Micromax Can4 comes at Rs 17000.means u waste Rs 24000..and these 24000 go to south Korea in dollars..

None of the indian products are subordinate in quality, they might look a bit less fancy!! 

Why is china so ahead, because the whole world uses made in china items.

We indians could atleast use made in india items! 

Change comes from within!  spread the change by broadcasting this msg to everyone on your contact list! 

lets see by the end of this year does 1$ become Rs. 70 or it becomes Rs. 50..

JAAAAGO.
Some of these we follow....but we can make our  possible to make a change.

15/02/15, 7:34 PM - Pornima Akka: In 1902, a professor asked his student whether it was God who created everything that exists in the universe?

Student replied: Yes

He again asked:
What about evil?
Has God created evil also?

The student got silent...
Then the student requested that may he ask a question for him?

Professor allowed him to do so.

He asked: Does cold exist?

Professor said: Yes! Don't you feel the cold dear?

Student said: I'm sorry but you are wrong sir. Cold is a complete absence of heat...
There is no cold, it is only an absence of heat.

Student asked again:
Does darkness exist?

Professor Said: Yes!

Student replied: you are again wrong sir. There is no such thing like darkness. Its actually the absence of light.

Sir! We always study light & heat, but not cold & darkness.

Similarly, the evil does not exist. Actually it is the absence of love, faith & true belief in God.

That student was...

Vivekananda...!!!

Once Krishna and Arjuna were walking towards a village. Arjuna was pestering Krishna, asking him why Karna should be considered an unparallelled Donor & not me.?

Krishna, turned two mountains into gold. 

Then said "Arjuna, distribute these two Gold mountains among villagers, but you must donate every bit of it ". 

Arjuna went into the village, and proclaimed he was going to donate gold to every villager, and asked them to gather near the mountain. The villagers sang his praises and Arjuna walked towards the mountain with a huffed up chest. 

For two days and two nights Arjuna shovelled gold from the mountain and donated to each villager. The mountains did not diminish in their slightest.

Most villagers came back and stood in queue within minutes. Now Arjuna was exhausted, but not ready to let go of Ego, told Krishna he couldn't go on any longer without rest. 

Here Krishna called Karna and told him to donate every bit of two Gold mountains.

Karna called two villagers,  and said "Those two Gold mountains are yours " and walked away.

Arjuna sat dumbfounded. Why hadn't this thought occurred to him? 

Krishna smiled mischievously and told him "Arjuna, subconsciously, you were attracted to the gold, you regretfully gave it away to each villager, giving them what you thought was a generous amount. Thus the size of your donation to each villager depended only on your imagination. 

Karna holds no such reservations. Look at him walking away after giving away a fortune, he doesn't expect people to sing his praises, he doesn't even care if people talk good or bad about him behind his back. That is the sign of a man already on the path of enlightenment".


Giving with an Expectation of a Return in the form of a Compliment or Thanks is not a Gift, then it becomes a Trade. 

" Give without expecting anything in Return.

Givers Gain 👌

17/02/15, 6:52 AM - Paiya perrippa: "YOU COULD BE SHAMELESS, I AM
NOT ..!!! " Lines by Ratan Tata.

Few months after 26/11, Taj group of Hotels owned by TATAs
launched their biggest tender ever for remodeling all their Hotels
in India and abroad. Some of the companies who applied for that tender were also Pakistanis. To make their bid stronger, two big industrialists from Pakistan visited Bombay House ( Head office of Tata ) in Mumbai without an appointment to meet up with Ratan Tata since he was not giving them any prior appointment. They were made to sit at the reception of Bombay house and after a few hours a message was conveyed to them that Ratan Tata
is busy and can not meet anyone without an appointment.
Frustrated, these two Paki industrialists went to Delhi and thru their High Commission met up with a Minister. The minister immediately called up Ratan Tata requesting him to meet up with the two Paki
Industrialists and consider their tender "enthusiastically ly". Ratan Tata replied..."you could be shameless, I am not" and put the
phone down. Few months later when Pakistani government placed an order of Tata Sumo's to be imported into Pakistan, Ratan Tata refused to ship a single vehicle to that country. This is the respect and love for motherland that Ratan Tata has. Something that our current Politicians should learn from. Hats off to you sir..
Awake Country men, the Nation is above everything else.

வசதியாகத்தான் இருக்கிறது மகனே…
நீ கொண்டு வந்து சேர்த்த
முதியோர் இல்லம்
பொறுப்பாய் என்னை 
ஒப்படைத்து விட்டு சலனமின்றி நீ
வெளியேறிய போது, முன்பு நானும்
இது போல் உன்னை
வகுப்பறையில் விட்டு விட்டு
என் முதுகுக்குப் பின்னால்
நீ கதறக் கதறக்
கண்ணீரை மறைத்தபடி
புறப்பட்ட காட்சி
ஞாபகத்தில் எழுகிறது!

முதல் தரமிக்க
இந்த இல்லத்தை
தேடித் திரிந்து
நீ தேர்ந்தெடுத்ததை அறிகையில்கூட
அன்று உனக்காக நானும்
பொருத்தமான பள்ளி
எதுவென்றே
ஓடி அலைந்ததை
ஒப்பீடு செய்கிறேன்!

இதுவரையில்
ஒருமுறையேனும்
என் முகம் பார்க்க
நீ வராமல் போனாலும்
என் பராமரிப்பிற்கான
மாதத் தொகையை
மறக்காமல்
அனுப்பி வைப்பதற்காக
மனம் மகிழ்ச்சியடைகிறது
நீ விடுதியில்
தங்கிப் படித்த காலத்தில்
உன்னைப் பார்க்க வேண்டும் என்ற
ஆவல் இருந்தாலும்
படிப்பை நினைத்து
உன்னை சந்திக்க மறுத்ததன்
எதிர்வினையே இதுவென்று
இப்போது அறிகிறேன்!

இளம் வயதினில்
நீ சிறுகச் சிறுக சேமித்த
அனுபவத்தை
என் முதுமைப் பருவத்தில்
மொத்தமாக எனக்கே
செலவு செய்கிறாய்
ஆயினும்…
உனக்கும் எனக்கும்
ஒரு சிறு வேறுபாடு
நான் கற்றுக்கொடுத்தேன்
உனக்கு…
வாழ்க்கை இதுதானென்று
நீ கற்றுக் கொடுக்கிறாய்
எனக்கு…
உறவுகள் இதுதானென்று!

24/02/15, 1:01 PM - Paiya perrippa: Corporate lesson :Jack and Max are walking to the church for the Sunday prayer.. 

Jack wonders whether it would be all right to smoke while praying.

Max replies, “Why don’t you ask the Priest?”

So Jack goes up to the Priest and asks, “Father, may I smoke while I pray?”

The Priest replies, “No, my son, you may not! That’s utter disrespect to our religion.”

Jack goes back to his friend and tells him what the good Priest told him.

Max says, “I’m not surprised. You asked the wrong question. Let me try.”

And so Max goes up to the Priest and asks, “Father, may I pray while I smoke?”

To which the Priest eagerly replies, “By all means, my son. By all means. You can always pray whenever you want to.”

Moral of the story: The approval you want depends on the way u ask for it!!

25/02/15, 1:11 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: The cockroach theory for In development👍
     
At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and  sat on a lady. 

She started screaming out of fear. 

With a panic stricken face and trembling voice,she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.

Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.

The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ...it landed on another lady in the group.

Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.

The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.

In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.

The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.

When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.

Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach 
responsible for their histrionic behavior?

If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?

He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.

It is not the cockroach, but the inability of the ladies to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach that disturbed the ladies.

I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.

It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.

More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.

Lessons learnt from the story:

I understood, I should not react in life.

I should always respond.

The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded.

Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of.
A beautiful way to understand............LIFE.
Person who is HAPPY is not because Everything is RIGHT in his Life..

He is HAPPY because his Attitude towards Everything in his Life is Right..!!,,,,,,,

02/03/15, 9:41 PM - Pornima Akka: Aadhaar card :
A Must Must Read 
A Scene in 2020...

Operator: 
Hello Pizza Hut!

Customer: Hello, can you please take my order?

Operator : Can I have your multi purpose Aadhar card number first, Sir?

Customer: Yeah! 
Hold on..... My number is 889861356102049998xxxxx

Operator : OK... you're... Mr SYED and you're calling from 155, 1st Cross. Panduranga Nagar, MG Road, Hyderabad. . Your home number is 26490xxx, your office 22211xxx and your mobile is 9880088xxxx. You are calling from you home number now.

Customer: (Astonished) How did you get all my phone numbers?

Operator : We are connected to the system, Sir.

Customer: I wish to order your Seafood Pizza...

Operator : That's not a good idea Sir.

Customer: How come?

Operator : According to your medical records, you have high blood pressure and even higher cholesterol level, sir.

Customer: What?... What do you recommend then?

Operator : Try our Low Fat Hokkien Mee Pizza. You'll like it.

Customer: How do you know for sure?

Operator : You borrowed a book titled 'Popular Hokkien Dishes' from the National Library last week, sir.

Customer: OK I give up... Give me three family size ones then.

Operator : That should be enough for your family of 07. Sir. The total is Rs. 2,450.

Customer: Can I pay by credit card?

Operator : I'm afraid you have to pay us cash, Sir. Your credit card is over the limit and you owe your bank Rs. 1,51,758 since October last year. That's not including the late payment charges on your housing loan, Sir.

Customer: I guess I have to run to the neighbourhood ATM and withdraw some cash before your guy arrives.

Operator : You can't Sir. Based on the records, you've exhausted even your overdraft limit.

Customer: Never mind just send the pizzas, I'll have the cash ready. How long is it gonna take anyway?

Operator : About 45 minutes Sir, but if you can't wait you can always come and collect it on your motorcycle.

Customer: What?

Operator : According to the details in the system , you own a motorcycle registration number 7786

Customer: "????" (hmmm.. these guys know my motorcyle number too!)

Operator : Is there anything else, sir?

Customer: Nothing.! .. by the way... aren't you giving me that 3 free bottles of cola as advertised?

Operator : We normally would sir, but based on your records, you're also diabetic... In the best interest of your health, we are holding this offer for you.

Customer: teri 

Operator: Better mind your language sir. Remember on 10th July 1986 you were imprisoned for 3 days and fined Rs.5,000 for using abusive language against a policeman...?

Customer faints...😀😛😀 aur banao Aadhaar Card ...

05/03/15, 2:16 PM - natarajan ramu: பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் - அறிந்ததும் அறியாததும் !

 பொதுவாக நம் மக்களிடையே , பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் பற்றிய விழிப்புணர்வுகளைக் காட்டிலும் , பயம் தான் அதிகமாக உள்ளது..
மக்களின் பயத்தை மூலதனமாகக்கொண்டு ,பல்வேறு தொழில்துறையினர் அதன்மூலம் லாபம் அடைகின்றனர்! இறுதிவரை நம் மக்கள் பயத்துடனே , பன்றிக்காய்ச்சலை பற்றிய அடிப்படை விடயங்களை தெரிந்து கொள்ளாமலே போய் விடுகின்றனர்..

2009 ஆம் ஆண்டு , உலகம் முழுவதும் உள்ள மக்கள் இந்த வைரஸ் நோய்கிருமிகளால் பாதிக்கப்பட்ட போதே , நம் ஆட்சியாளர்கள் மற்றும் சமூக ஆர்வலர்கள் அதனை பற்றிய விழிப்புணர்வை ஏற்படுத்தினர்.. ஆனால் அது நம் மக்களை முறையாக சென்றடையவில்லை.. நமது அரைகுறை புரிதலின் தாக்கமே , இப்போது 2015ஆம் ஆண்டு மீண்டும் பயத்துடன்  பன்றிக்காய்ச்சலை அணுகுகின்றோம்..

மக்கள் பலருக்கு உள்ள சந்தேகங்களும் , அதற்கான விடைகளையும் சற்று ஆராய்வோம் ..

கேள்வி - ஏன் இதற்கு பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல்  என பெயரிடப்பட்டது ?

பதில்-  இந்தக்  காய்ச்சல்  முதன்முதலில்  பன்றிகளிடம் அதிகளவு காணப்பட்டதால் இதற்கு அந்தப் பெயர் கொடுப்பட்டது..   இது குறிப்பாக பன்றிகளின் நுரையீரல் மண்டலத்தைத் தாக்கக்கூடிய வைரஸ்நோய்!  

கேள்வி - பன்றிகள் அதிகம் உள்ள ஊர்களில் தான் இந்த காய்ச்சல் இருக்குமா ? 

பதில்  -   அவ்வாறு இருக்க வேண்டிய அவசியம் இல்லை.  இந்த வைரஸ் , பன்றிகள் மூலமாக  மனிதர்களைத் தாக்கினாலும். பிறகு   பாதிக்கப்பட்ட நபரின் சளி , இருமல், தும்மல் மூலமாக சக மனிதர்களுக்குப் பரவும்...

 கே -இது எய்ட்ஸ்  , எபோலா போன்றதொரு கொடிய வைரஸா ?

ப-  இல்லவே இல்லை..இது ஒரு சாதாரணமான  வைரஸ்..பனிக்காலங்களில் இதனின் உக்கிரம் சற்று அதிகமாக காணப்படுவதால் ,நாம்  விழிப்புடன் இருப்பது நல்லது!  

கே -இந்த வைரஸ் யாரை எல்லாம் எளிதாகத் தாக்கும்? 

ப- பொதுவாக நோய்எதிர்ப்பு சக்தி குறைவாக உள்ள நபர்களை இந்த வைரஸ் எளிதாகத் தாக்கும். குறிப்பாக குழந்தைகள், முதியவர்கள் , கர்ப்பிணி தாய்மார்கள்,  சக்கரை நோயாளிகளிடம் இந்த பாதிப்பு அதிகளவில் காணப்படும்.  இருப்பினும் இது யாரை வேண்டுமானாலும் தாக்கலாம் ,.

கே -இந்த வைரஸ் காய்ச்சலில் இருந்து எப்படி தப்பிப்பது ?
 
ப- மிகவும் எளிதான வழிமுறை தான்.. ஆனால் நாம் தான் அவற்றை கடைப்பிடிக்க மறுக்கின்றோம்.. 
இந்த  வைரஸ், பாதிக்கப்பட்ட நபரின் சளி , இருமல், தும்மல் மூலமாகத் தான் சக மனிதர்களுக்குப் பரவுகின்றது.

 1.எனவே , பொது இடங்களில் இருமல் , மற்றும் தும்மல் வரும்போது மற்றவர்கள் மேல் படாதவாறு ஒரு துணி  , கர்சீப் அல்லது டிஷூ பேப்பரை பயன்படுத்த வேண்டும்..

2. நாம் பயன்படுத்திய துணி , கர்சீப் , டிஷூ பேப்பரை பாதுகாப்பாக அப்புறப்படுத்த வேண்டும் ஒரே துணி மற்றும் கர்சீபை  பல நாட்கள்  பயன்படுத்துவதும் தவறு.அவற்றை வெந்நீரில் கொதிக்க வைத்தப்பின் தான் மறுபடியும் பயன்படுத்த வேண்டும்.

3. ஒரே வீட்டில் உள்ள நபர்கள் , அவர்களுக்கென்று தனித்தனியாக டவல் , கர்சீப் , சோப்புகளை பயன்படுத்த வேண்டும்.. குழந்தைகளை கையாளும் முன்னர் , கைகளை சோப்பு போட்டு சுத்தம் செய்ய வேண்டும். 

4.யாருக்காவது சற்று அதிகமாக சளி , இருமல் இருப்பின் அவர்களுக்கு அருகில் நீண்ட நேரம் இருக்கக்கூடாது.குறிப்பாக குழந்தைகள் மற்றும் முதியவர்கள் பாதிக்கப்பட்ட நபரை  3-7 நாட்கள்வரை பார்க்காமல் இருப்பதே நல்லது..

5.குழந்தைகளுக்கு இந்த காய்ச்சலின் அறிகுறி இருந்தால் , அவர்களை பள்ளிக்கூடங்களுக்கு  5 நாட்கள் வரை அனுப்புவதை தவிர்க்கவேண்டும். (ஒரு வாரம் அவர்களுக்கு ஓய்வு மிக அவசியம்.. பெற்றோர்கள் அவர்களை வலுக்கட்டாயமாக பள்ளிக்கு அனுப்புவதை தவிர்க்கவேண்டும்).

6. மக்கள் அதிகம் கூடும் இடத்திற்கு செல்வதை  குறைத்துக்கொள்ள வேண்டும். (கோவில்கள், திரை அரங்குகள் , மார்கெட், நெடுதூர இரயில், பேருந்து பயணங்கள் போன்றவை)

கே -பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் நோயின் அறிகுறிகள் என்ன? 
ப-  சாதாரண காய்ச்சல் , சளி , இருமல், தொண்டை கரகரப்பு , உடம்பு வலி , தலைவலி , குளிர்காய்ச்சல் , மற்றும் சிலருக்கு வாந்தி , பேதி கூட இருக்கலாம்.. 
இவை அனைத்தும் 99 % நபர்களுக்கு ஒரு வாரத்தில் குணமடைந்து விடும்.

கே - மருத்துவமனைகளில் கிடைக்கும் அறுவை சிகிச்சை மாஸ்க் பயன்படுத்தினால் , இந்த வைரஸ் பரவுவதை தடுக்க முடியுமா? 

ப-   அறுவைசிகிச்சை மாஸ்க் பயன்படுத்துவது பயன்அளிக்காது..ஏனெனில்   இந்த வைரஸுகளை அதுமுழுமையாக கட்டுப்படுத்தாது.. மேலும் இரண்டு மணிநேரத்திற்கு மேல்  ஒருமுறை அவற்றை மாற்றிக்கொண்டே இருக்க வேண்டும்.. மேலும் , அவற்றை முறையாக அப்புறப்படுத்த வேண்டும்.. எனவே சாதாரண சர்ஜிகல் மாஸ்க் கை நோய்தடுப்பிற்காக உபயோகிப்பது வீண்.. அவசியம் ஏற்பட்டால் ஒன்றின் மீது ஒன்றாக மூன்று மாஸ்க்குகளை அணிந்து கொள்ளலாம்( இவற்றையும் இரண்டு மணிநேரத்திற்குத் தான் பயன்படுத்தவேண்டும்.). அல்லது N-95 என்ற சிறப்பு மாஸ்க்கை பயன்படுத்தலாம்..

கே -இந்த  பன்றிக்காய்ச்சலுக்கு வைத்தியம்  என்ன? கண்டிப்பாக மருத்துவரை நாட வேண்டுமா ?

ப- முதலாவது  மற்றும் முக்கியமானது ,முழுமையான ஓய்வு (டிவி பார்ப்பது , செல்போன் அதிகமாக பயன்படுத்துவதையும் சேர்த்து).. பிறகு தங்குமிடத்தை தூய்மையாக வைத்துக்கொள்ளுதல் - பயன்படுத்திய கர்சீப் , துணிகளை முறையாக அப்புறப்படுத்துதல் , அதிகளவு தண்ணீர் குடித்தல்( 2-3 லிட்டர் ), எளிதில் ஜீரணிக்க கூடிய உணவுகளை உண்ணுதல் போன்றவையே 99%பன்றிக்காய்ச்சலை குணப்படுத்திவிடும்.. காய்ச்சலுக்கு பாராசிடமால் மாத்திரைகளை பயன்படுத்தலாம்..ஆண்டிபயாடிக் மருந்துகள் பெரிதாக பய்ன்தராது..
 
கே - எப்போது மருத்துவரை /மருத்துவமனையை அணுகவேண்டும் ?

ப- மேற்கூறிய அறிகுறிகளுடன் , முச்சுத்தினறல் இருந்தாலோ , அல்லது அதிகப்படியான காய்ச்சல்  -தலைவலி-வாந்தி - குளிர்காய்ச்சல் இருந்தாலோ மருத்துவர்களை அணுகவேண்டும். .

கே - தடுப்பூசிகள்  பயன் அளிக்குமா ? அவசியம் தடுப்பூசிகளை போட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டுமா ?

ப-  பொதுவாக குளிர்காலம் துவங்குவதற்கு 15 நாட்கள் முன்னே , தடுப்பூசிகளை போட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும். . சமுதாயத்தில்  பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் பரவிய பின்னர் , தடுப்பூசி போட்டுக்கொள்வது பெரிதாக பயன்தராது..(எனவே  இந்த ஆண்டு தடுப்பூசி போட்டுக்கொள்ளாதவர்கள் ,  நாம் தடுப்பூசி போட்டுக்கொள்ளவில்லையே என்று அச்சப்படத் தேவை இல்லை)
 

 பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் குறித்தான  செய்திகளை உங்கள் நண்பர்களிடத்தில் பகிருங்கள் ! அதன்மூலம்  முழுமையான விழிப்புணர்வை  சமுதாயத்தில் ஏற்படுத்துவோம் !

பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் மேல் உள்ள அச்சங்களை முதலில் போக்குவோம்!
பன்றிக்காய்ச்சல் பரவுவதைத் தடுப்போம்! 
அவற்றை  எதிர்கொண்டு மீள்வோம்!

07/03/15, 9:53 AM - natarajan ramu: Indian government has launched a scheme called DigiLocker. 
Anyone having an Aadhar card can login to www.digilocker.gov.in and upload scanned copies of all the important documents like 10th marksheet, 12th marksheet, Graduation certificate, electricity bill, PAN, Driving License, Passport etc. So
whenever, you will need those documents (for verification by govt agencies while applying for any service etc), you can directly give your locker number and it is done! No more hassles of carrying those documents and tons of photocopies.

SHARE IT..!
07/03/15, 3:19 PM - Pornima Akka: Good info!
08/03/15, 10:04 PM - natarajan ramu: This is one of the best posts I've read about woman... pl read it completely... it's worth it...

 

 

 

WOMAN. . . . . . . . .       

                                                                          

When God created woman he was working late on the 6th day.......

 

An angel came by and asked." Why spend so much time on her ?".

.                                         

The lord answered. " Have you seen all the  specifications I have to meet to shape her?"..... 

 

 

she must function on all kinds of situations....,

 

she must be able to embrace several kids at the same time,

 

 

give a hug that can heal anything from a bruised knee to a broken heart ,

 

she must do all this with only two hands,.."

 

She cures herself when sick and can work 18 hours a day".... ...                                                                                             

THE ANGEL was impressed. .." Just two hands.....impossible !" ..

 

And this is the standard model ? ! ...."

 

The Angel came closer and touched the woman"......  ..

 

." But you have made her so soft, Lord".....

 

." She is soft", said the Lord,

 

" But I have made her strong. You can't imagine what she can endure and overcome "...

 

."Can she think?" The Angel asked...

 

The Lord answered. " Not only can she think, she can reason and negotiate" ...

.

The Angel touched her cheeks.....

 

" Lord, it seems this creation is leaking !  You have put too many burdens on her. " ...

 

."She is not leaking...it is a tear" The Lord corrected the Angel...

 

" What's it for?" Asked the Angel..... .

.

The Lord said. " Tears are her way of expressing her grief, her doubts, her love, her loneliness, her suffering and her pride."...

 

THIS made a big impression on the Angel,

 

" Lord, you are genius. You thought of everything.

A  woman is indeed marvellous !".... ...

.

Lord said." Indeed she is.

 

She has strength that amazes a man.

 

She can handle trouble and carry heavy burdens.

 

She holds happiness, love and opinions.

 

She smiles when she feels like screaming.

 

She sings when she feels like crying, cries when happy and laughs when afraid.

 

She fights for what she believes in.

 

Her love is unconditional.

 

Her heart is broken when a next-of-kin or a friend dies

 

but she finds strength to get on with life." ..

 

The Angel asked : So she is a perfect ?

 

The lord replied : No. She has just one drawback

 

" She often forgets what she is worth".

 

Send it to all the women u respect ....👍

And to all men who respect woman  👍👍

"65% of population who doesn't pay taxes, 21 million illegal immigrants, 9,00,000 criminals in over 1382 prisons and above all 544+ MPs in parliament".
They said, this is not an acceptable answer.

24/03/15, 6:59 AM - Paiya perrippa: Triple Filter 😊〰〰〰〰〰〰
In ancient India, One day a person met the great Chanakya,  and said, "Do you know what I just heard about your friend?"

"Hold on a minute," Chanakya replied."Before telling me anything I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test."

"Triple filter?""That's right," Chanakya continued."Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you're going to say.That's why I call it the triple filter test.

The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?" 

"No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and..."

"All right," said Chanakya."So you don't know if it's true or not.Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness.

Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?"

"No, on the contrary..."

"So," Chankaya continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, but you're not certain it's true.

You may still pass the test though, because there's one filter left, the filter of Usefulness.

Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?"

"No, not really.""Well," concluded chankaya, "if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?"____________________________

Use this triple filter each time you hear loose talk about any of your near and dear ones.👌

24/03/15, 1:26 PM - natarajan ramu: One of the best msg in the recent days I liked most is
There are four yugas widely accepted in Hinduism. They are :
1.Satya yug
2.Treta yug (Ramayana)
3.Dwapara yug(Mahabharata)
4.Kal yug(Present)

In Satya yug, the figtht was between two worlds.(Devalok & Asuralok) Asuralok being the evil, was a different WORLD.

In Treta yug, the fight was between Rama and Ravana. Both rulers from two different COUNTRIES.

In Dwapara yug, the fight was between Pandavas and Kauravas. Both good and evil from the SAME FAMILY.

Kindly note how the evil is getting closer. For example, from a DIFFERENT WORLD to a DIFFERENT COUNTRY to the SAME FAMILY.

Now, know where is the evil in Kaliyug???

It is inside us. Both GOOD AND EVIL LIVE WITHIN. The battle is within us. Who will we give victory to, our inner goodness or the evil within??
Think, identify and fight the evil .....

After taking you in confidence they will ask to handover the 2 cheques along with ID Proof to the person deputed by them and  also details of person to be enrolled for medical insurance ( additional benefits) . The person who will visit you will ask u that he can help in filling the cheques and fill the cheques with his own pen ( Magic Pen) and will finally ask you to sign the cheque with your own pen. This is catch and fraud point. The ink of pen with which the person filled the cheque get evaporated after 30 to 45 minutes and it is being used by them as bearer cheque and withdraw the cash from your account bcoz signature of yours on cheque remains there as being signed by your own pen. The Id proof which they will take from you will be utilized by them to find the balance amount in your account by making the telephone to bank. By now they have your account no and Id proof and others details on behalf of which the bank inform them the balance amount and they will fill the amount just leaving 2 to 3 thousand in account.  After collection of cheques from you they will keep you busy in different talks so that by the time their person reaches the bank . By this time they will take you again in confidence and will ask you to shut down your phone for 30 to 40 mins by pretending different reason of medical verifications etc. This is being done by them so that they can withdraw the payment from your account and transaction alert from bank will not reach you. After 45 mins when you will open the phone you will we having the transaction alert message but by that time your account will be almost empty. Only you can get the cctv footage from Bank in which you can have the look on person who had withdrawn the payment.

18/04/15, 6:10 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: Have you been subjected to the door test yet? The picture test has gone viral. How is it doing so well? It's based on the surprising accuracy the results provide! The task is simple, look at the photos of doors and choose which speaks to you the most. Then coordinate your choice with the explanation and be in awe at the remarkable accuracy.

"If you choose Door #1: 

Your path is freeing. You are the type of person who needs a ton of space. You need the freedom to do things your own way, you prefer a path that you carve yourself, especially one with infinite possibilities and routes. You don’t want to feel constrained and are highly independent, rebellious even, but you don’t like confrontation. You’re more likely to passively resist someone or something. You hate being rushed, and prefer to take the to  time savour life. You’re too busy enjoying life to draw attention to yourself.

If you chose Door #2:

Your path is private. You are the kind of person who prefers to travel alone. You like to observe, think, and sort out whatever is in your head. You prefer a path that’s fit for one. You can see others once you arrive at your destination, but you need your downtime first. You are very original and insightful. You look at the world in a unique way, and others can benefit from your point of view. You are a bit of a loner, but you connect well with people when you take the time. You are very understanding.

If you chose door #3:

Your path is colorful. You are a very engaging and engaged person. You love to be part of the world… you like to experience it all. Your ideal path is filled with colour, excitement and beauty. For you, it’s more about the journey than the destination. You are curious and excited to learn more. You love to start conversations, and you ask lots of questions. You are intellectual and witty. You think of more zingers than you’d ever use, and you keep people laughing (This was also my choice!)

If you chose door #4:


Your path is exciting! You are always moving forward in life, often into the unknown. You just go for it and deal with the consequences later. Your ideal path is unpredictable and maybe a little scary. You are drawn to the unknown. You can be a rule breaker, and you’re even somewhat careless. You have been known to act without thinking, but it usually all works out for you. You are very spontaneous and a major thrill seeker. You are going to make the most of the time you’ve been given on this planet!

If you chose door #5:

Your path is welcoming. You are a peace-seeking low maintenance person. You are very content, and you don’t like to be bothered. Your ideal path is clear cut and enjoyable. You want to enjoy your trip and to know what you’re getting into. You will often take the easy choice whenever possible. Life is hard enough, and you never want to make it harder on yourself, you are stable and supportive of those around you. You are known for your consistency and down to earth perspective.

If you chose door #6:

Your path is quiet. You value solitude in all aspects of your life. You can spend large periods of time alone without feeling lonely. Your ideal path is one that is very still and quiet. You want to absorb everything around you without feeling overwhelmed. You seek meaning in every aspect of life. You live your life very deliberately- both in action and in thought. You don’t like crowds, but you do like people. You value authentic relationships, and you prefer the depth of one on one interaction."

கடைக்காரர் விரட்டி விட்டார்.. திரும்ப திரும்ப அந்த நாய் கடைக்கு வந்துச்சு… என்னடா பெரிய தொல்லையா போச்சுன்னு வெளிய வந்து பார்த்தா அந்த நாய் வாயில ஒரு சீட்டும் பணமும் இருந்துச்சு…

கடைக்காரர் ஆச்சர்யமாகி அந்த சீட்டை எடுத்து அதில் உள்ள சாமான்களை போட்டு, மீதி பணத்தையும் அதே பையில் நாய் கழுத்தில் மாட்டிவிட்டார். .. நாய் திரும்பி நடக்க ஆரம்பிச்சுது..

கடைக்காரர் சுவாரசியமாகி நாய் பின்னாலே நடக்க ஆரம்பித்தார்..

அந்த நாய் தெருவை கடந்து மெயின் ரோட்டிற்கு வந்தது.. அப்போது ரெட் சிக்னல்.. அந்த நாய் ரோட்’டை கடக்காமல் நின்றது…

பச்சை லைட் விழுந்தவுடன் ரோட்டை கடந்தது…

கடைக்காரருக்கு ஆச்சர்யம் தாங்கவில்லை… அது பின்னாலே அதன் வீடு செல்ல முடிவெடுத்தார். ..

அந்த நாய் ஒரு பேருந்து நிறுத்தத்தில் நின்றது..

ஒரு குறுப்பிட்ட பேருந்து வந்தவுடன் நாய் பேருந்தில் ஏறியது..

கண்டக்டரும் நாய் வாயில் இருந்த பணத்தை எடுத்துக்கொண்டு ஒரு டிக்கெட் கொடுத்தார்..

இரண்டு நிறுத்தங்கள் கடந்து நாய் பேருந்தில் இருந்து இறங்கியது…

கடைகாரரும் அதன் பின்னால் இறங்கினார்…

நாய் ஒரு தெருவை கடந்து ஒரு வீட்டின் முன் நின்று கதவை தட்டியது…

கதவு திறந்து ஒரு ஆள் வந்தார்…

நாயின் கழுத்தில் உள்ள பையை கழட்டி விட்டு நாயை அடித்தார்….

கடைக்காரர் ஓடி சென்று : நிறுத்துங்க?? ஏன் அடிக்கறீங்க?? அது எவ்வளவு பொறுப்பா கடைக்கு போயிட்டு, சிக்னல் மதிச்சு, பஸ்ல டிக்கெட் எடுத்துகிட்டு வருது அதை போய் அடிக்கறீங்களே …???

அதுக்கு அந்த ஆள் சொன்னார் வீடு சாவிய எடுத்துட்டு போகாம வந்து கதவ தட்டுது பாருங்க.. நாய்க்கு கொஞ்சம் கூட பொறுப்பே இல்லன்னு….

# நீதி : நமக்கு மேல உள்ள முதலாளிங்க மேனேஜர் எல்லாரும் இப்படி தான்.. நீ எவ்வளவு தான் பொறுப்பா இருந்தாலும் உனக்கு நல்ல பெயரே கிடைக்காது.

22/04/15, 5:13 PM - Pornima Akka: Benefits Of Eating With Hands

Many people find eating with hands unhygienic and disgusting but the connection of eating food with hands is not only with the body but also with the mind and soul. Lets know the benefits of it.

Within many Indian households nowadays, the practice of eating food with the hands has been replaced with the use of cutlery but very few know the benefits of having food with hands.
Benefits – Eating With Hands

The ancient tradition of eating with hands is derived from mudra (postures) practices and are widespread in many aspects within Hinduism. As we know that hands postures are used during mediation and Yoga. Even in many classical forms of dance, hand postures are important.

* As per Vedic knowledge, our hands and feet consist of the five elements – Space, Air, Fire, Water and Earth. Practice of eating with hands is also mentioned in Ayurveda. As per Ayurvedic texts, each finger is an extension of one of the five elements:

    Thumb: Fire
    Index finger: Air
    Middle finger: Heaven/ Ether
    Ring finger: Earth
    Little finger: Water

Five Elements in Hand

Each finger transforms food in digestive form before it passes to human digestion system. Improved digestion enhances the pleasure of eating as taste, texture and smell is felt better while having food with hands.

* The skin sends the senses to the brain about the temperature, texture of the food and this acts like a catalyst in the action of generating the necessary salivary juices.

* Eating with the hands, one can verify the temperature of the food before and it can prevent one from burning of the mouth.

* Some people believe that hands behave as energetic cleanser when the food passes via hand to mouth. Similar kind of tradition is followed in other religion also when people eat food after placing their palms above the food.

The logic behind it that food contains various external energies positives, negatives, pains, emotions, thoughts etc when it passes from various people like vegetable/ spice seller, cook, waiter etc. It is believed hands help cleaning all external energies so that it could not impact the human soul.

A similar pattern is found in many people coming from abroad that they feel suffocation and negative feelings when they eat through knife and fork. On the other hand, if they eat with their hands, they experience heavenly and divine feeling.
Science Behind Eating With Hands

We have some bacteria, known as normal flora, found on our skin. These bacteria are not harmful to human instead they protect us from many harmful bacteria from outside environment.

It is required to establish normal flora in various parts of our body like in mouth, throat, intestine, gut etc for the betterment of health.

Eating with spoon for long time can change the arrangement of normal flora. With this, the pattern of normal flora can be changed in the gut. It results reduced synchronous immunity to environmental bacterial germs.

Lets take an example, in India, when some people come from abroad after spending several years of staying there mostly suffer from acute gastroenteritis whereas the local people don’t, because their normal flora and gut flora are in sync.

Karaagre Vasate Lakssmih Karamadhye Sarasvati |
Karamuule sthithey gowri Prabhaate Karadarshanam ||

i.e. At the Top of the Palm Dwell Devi Lakshmi and at the Middle of the Hand Dwell Devi Saraswati, At the Base of the Hand Dwell gowri (parvati); Therefore one should Look at one’s Hands in the Early Morning and contemplate on Them. Hence, This shloka suggests that the divinity lies inside our hands.

Many things within Hindu culture seem weird and unusual but once we go deep into it, we find that a surprising and vast amount of knowledge is hidden in Vedic culture

29/04/15, 3:16 PM - Pornima Akka: During a robbery in Hong Kong, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: 
"Don't move. The money belongs to the Government. Your life belongs to you."

Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. 

 
This is called "Mind Changing Concept” Changing the conventional way of thinking.

When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school):
"Big brother, let's count how much we got." 

 
The older robber rebutted and said:
"You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!" 

 
This is called "Experience” 
Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! 

After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: 
"Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”.

 
This is called "Swim with the tide” 
Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage!

The supervisor says: "It will be good if there is a robbery every month."  

 
This is called "Changing priority” 
Personal Happiness is more important than your job”.

The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. 

 
The robbers were very angry and complained:
"We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!" 

 
This is called "Knowledge is worth as much as gold!"

02/05/15, 8:53 AM - natarajan ramu: படித்ததில் பிடித்தது.. பில்கேட்ஸ் இறந்தபின் எமனுடைய அவையில் நிறுத்தப்பட்டிருந்தார்.

எமன் சொன்னான்,

"நான் இந்த கேசில் மிகவும் குழப்பத்தில் இருக்கிறேன், உனக்கு சொர்க்கமா?.. நரகமா? ... எல்லாவற்றிற்கும் மேலாக, இந்த சமுதாயத்தில் ஏறக்குறைய அனைத்து வீடுகளிலும் கணினி உபயோகிக்க செய்து விட்டாய், அதோடு "படு பயங்கரமான விண்டோஸையும் " உருவாக்கிவிட்டாய்.அதனால் நான் இதற்குமுன் செய்யாத ஒன்றை உனக்காக செய்யப்போகிறேன்... உனக்கு சொர்க்கமா? நரகமா? என்பதை உன் முடிவிற்கே விட்டுவிடுகிறேன்."

"நல்லது கடவுளே!ஆனால் இரண்டுக்கும் என்ன வேறுபாடு?"

" ஒகே! இரண்டின் வேறுபாட்டையும் நீ நேரில் பார்த்து முடிவாக உன் பதிலை சொல்! , வா என்னோடு, முதலில் நரகத்தை பார்ப்போம்!"

"அப்படியே செய்வோம் எமதர்மராஜா ! வாருங்கள் போகலாம்"

நரகத்தைப் பார்த்ததும் ஆச்சர்யத்தின் உச்சத்திற்கே சென்றுவிட்டார் பில்கேட்ஸ்.

இதுவா நரகம்? ... தெளிவான நீரோடு, வெண்மையான பெரிய கடற்கரை, கண்ணை கவரும் இளம் நங்கைகள் சிரித்துக்கொண்டும், விளையாடிக் கொண்டும் இருக்க, இதமான சூரிய ஒளி...

"ஆஹா ! அருமை !" இதுதான் நரகம் என்றால், எனக்கு சொர்கத்தை பார்க்க அவகாசமில்லை.." என்று பில்கேட்ஸ் சொன்னபோதும்

"வா சொர்கத்தை பார்க்கலாம்.." என சொர்க்கத்துக்கு அழைத்துச் சென்றார் எமன்.

அங்கே,

நீல ஆகாயம், சிறு சிறு வெண் மேகங்கள், தேவதைகள் ஆடிப்பாடி களித்திருக்க .. அருமை. ஆனால் பில்கேட்ஸ்க்கு, நரகத்தை போல சொர்க்கம் அவரைக் கவரவில்லை..

நீண்ட யோசனைக்குப்பின்,

"தர்மராஜா!, நான் நரகத்திற்கே போக ஆசைபடுகிறேன்" என்றார் பில்கேட்ஸ்.

"உன் விருப்பம்", எமன்.

இரண்டு வாரங்களுக்குப்பின்,

பில்கேட்ஸின் நிலையை சோதிக்க எமன் நரகத்திற்கு போனார்.

அங்கே, இருண்ட குகையில், கை, கால்கள் இரும்பு சங்கிலிகளால் பிணைக்கப்பட்டு பெரிய தீ சுவாலைகளுக்கு நடுவே துடித்துக்கொண்டிருக்க, எம கிங்கரர்கள் பில்கேட்ஸை சித்திரவதை செய்து கொண்டிருந்தார்கள்.

"எப்படி இருக்கே பில்கேட்ஸ்?" என்றான் எமன்.

பில்கேட்ஸ் கடுமையான வேதனையோடு, ஈனமான குரலில்,

"முடியல... நான் அன்று பார்த்த அழகிய கடற்கரை, இளம் மங்கைகள் எல்லாம் எங்கே?"

எமன் சொன்னான்,

"அட லூசு பய புள்ள, அது SCREEN SAVER டா !"

02/05/15, 10:32 PM - natarajan ramu: ஒரு கிராமத்தில் ஒரு அறிஞர்
இருந்தார். அவர் ஒரு பொருளாதார
மேதையா யிருந்தார். பல
மன்னர்கள் தங்கள்நாட்டுப்
பொருளாதாரத்தைச் சீர்படுத்த
அவர் ஆலோசனையை நாடினர்.
ஒருநாள் ஊர்த்தலைவர் அவர் முன்
வந்து அவரைப் பார்த்துக்
கிண்டலாகச் சொன்னார்” ஐயா!
அறிஞரே! நீங்கள் பெரிய அறிஞர்
என்று உலகமே பாராட்டுகிறது.
ஆனால் உங்கள் பையன் ஒரு அடி
முட்டாளாக இருக்கிறானே! தங்கம்,
வெள்ளி இவற்றுள் அதிகம் மதிப்பு
வாய்ந்தது எது என்று அவனைக்
கேட்டால் அவன் வெள்ளி என்று
சொல்கிறான். வெட்கக்கேடு!”
அறிஞர் மிக வருத்தமடைந்தார்.
பையனை அழைத்தார். கேட்டார்
”தங்கம், வெள்ளி இவை இரண்டில்
அதிகம் மதிப்பு வாய்ந்தது எது?”
பையன் சொன்னான்”தங்கம்”
அவர் கேட்டார் ”பின் ஏன்
ஊர்த்தலைவர் கேட்கும்போது
வெள்ளி என்று சொன்னாய்?”
பையன் சொன்னான்” தினமும்
நான் பள்ளி செல்லும்போது அவர்
ஒரு கையில் தங்க நாணயமும், மறு
கையில் வெள்ளி நாணயமும்
வைத்துக் கொண்டு என்னை
அறிஞரின் மகனே என அழைத்துச்
சொல்வார் ”இவ்விரண்டில்
மதிப்பு வாய்ந்ததை நீ எடுத்துக்
கொள் ”.
”நான் உடனே வெள்ளியை
எடுத்துக் கொள்வேன் .உடனே
அவரும் சுற்றி இருப்பவர்களும்
சிரித்துக் கிண்டல்
செய்வார்கள்.நான் அந்த
நாணயத்துடன் போய் விடுவேன்.
இது ஓராண்டாக நடக்கிறது. தினம்
எனக்கு ஒரு வெள்ளி நாணயம்
கிடைக்கிறது. நான் தங்கம் என்று
சொல்லி எடுத்துக் கொண்டால்
அன்றோடு இந்த விளையாட்டு
நின்று விடும். எனக்கு நாணயம்
கிடைப்பதும் நின்று போகும்.
எனவே தான்…” அறிஞர் திகைத்தார்!
வாழ்க்கையில் பல நேரங்களில்
நாம் முட்டாள்களாக வேடம்
அணிகிறோம், மற்றவர்கள் அதைப்
பார்த்து மகிழ்வதற்கு. ஆனால்
நாம் தோற்பதில்லை.அவர்கள்
வெல்வதாக எண்ணிக்
கொண்டிருப்பார்கள். ஆனால்
வேறு கோணத்தில்
பார்க்கும்போது நாம்
வென்றிருப்போம்! எந்தக் கோணம்
நமக்கு முக்கியம் என்பதை
நாம்தான் தீர்மானிக்க
வேண்டும்!

04/05/15, 2:00 PM - Pornima Akka: When Swami Vivekanand was studying law at the University College, London, a white professor, whose last name was Peters, disliked him intensely.

One day, Mr. Peters was having lunch at the dining room when vivekananda came along with his tray and sat next to the professor.

The professor said, "Mr Vivekanand , you do not understand. A pig and a bird do not sit together to eat."

Vivekanandji looked at him as a parent would a rude child and calmly replied, "You do not worry professor. I'll fly away," and he went and sat at another table.

Mr. Peters,  reddened with rage, decided to take revenge. 

The next day in Class he posed the following question: "Mr.Vivekanand , if you were walking down the street and found a package, and within was a bag of wisdom and another bag with money, which one would you take ?"

Without hesitating, Vivekanandji responded, "The one with the money, of course."

Mr. Peters , smiling sarcastically said, "I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom."

Swami Vivekanand shrugged and responded, "Each one takes what he doesn't have."

Mr. Peters, by this time was fit to be tied. So great was his anger that he wrote on Swami Vivekanand's exam sheet the word "idiot" and gave it to Swami Vivekanand.

Vivekanandji took the exam sheet and sat down at his desk trying very hard to remain calm while he contemplated his next move.

A  few  minutes later, Swami Vivekanand got up, went to the professor and told him in a dignified polite tone, "Mr. Peters, you signed the sheet, but you did not give me the grade."

😅😃. Don't mess with intelligent people.

08/05/15, 7:45 AM - Paiya perrippa: A father left 17 Camels as an Asset for his Three Sons.

When the Father passed away, his sons opened up the will.

The Will of the Father stated that the Eldest son should get Half of 17 Camels,

The Middle Son should be given 1/3rd of 17 Camels,

Youngest Son should be given 1/9th of the 17 Camels,

As it is not possible to divide 17 into half or 17 by 3 or 17 by 9, the sons started to fight with each other.

So, they decided to go to a wise man.

The wise man listened patiently about the Will. The wise man, after giving this thought, brought one camel of his own & added the same to 17. That increased the total to 18 camels.

Now, he started reading the deceased father’s will.

Half of 18 = 9.
So he gave 9 camels
to the eldest son.

1/3rd of 18 = 6.
So he gave 6 camels
to the middle son.

1/9th of 18 = 2.
So he gave 2 camels
to the youngest son.

Now add this up:
9 + 6 + 2 = 17 &
This leaves 1 camel,
which the wise man took back.

MORAL: The attitude of negotiation & problem solving is to find the 18th camel i.e. the common ground. Once a person is able to find the common ground, the issue is resolved. It is difficult at times.

However, to reach a solution, the first step is to believe that there is a solution. If we think that there is no solution, we won’t be able to reach any!

08/05/15, 11:54 AM - Pornima Akka: Can you hear a pin drop?
What is the meaning of pin drop silence?
Following are some instances when silence could speak louder than voice. 

Take 1:

Field Marshal Sam Bahadur Maneckshaw once started addressing a public meeting at Ahmedabad in English. The crowd started chanting, "Speak in Gujarati.  We will hear you only if you speak in Gujarati." Field Marshal Sam Bahadur Maneckshaw stopped. Swept the audience with a hard stare and replied, "Friends, I have fought many a battle in my long career.  I have learned Punjabi from men of the Sikh Regiment; Marathi from the Maratha Regiment; Tamil from the men of the Madras Sappers; Bengali from the men of the Bengal Sappers, Hindi from the Bihar Regiment; and even Nepali from the Gurkha Regiment.   Unfortunately there was no soldier from Gujarat from whom I could have learned Gujarati.".............

You could have heard a pin drop
--------------------------------------------------

Take 2:

JFK'S Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, was in France in the early 60's when Charles DeGaule, the French President, decided to pull out of NATO.
  
DeGaule said he wanted all US military out of France as soon as possible.

Rusk responded, "does that include the 180,000 who are buried here ?" 

DeGaule could not respond.

You could have heard a pin drop -------------------------------------------------

Take 3:

Robert Whiting, an elderly US gentleman of 83, arrived in Paris by plane. 

At French Customs, he took a few minutes to locate his passport in his carry on.

"You have been to France before, Monsieur ?"  , the Customs officer asked sarcastically.

Mr. Whiting admitted that he had been to France previously.

"Then you should know enough to have your passport ready." 

The American said, “The last time I was here, I didn't have to show it."

"Impossible.  Americans always have to show their passports on arrival in France !" , the Customs officer sneered.

The American senior gave the Frenchman a long, hard look. 

Then he quietly explained ... 

"Well, when I came ashore at Omaha Beach, at 4:40am, on D-Day in 1944, to help liberate your country, I couldn't find a single Frenchman to show a passport to.... " 

.............

You could have heard a pin drop
--------------------------

Soon after getting freedom from British rule in 1947, the de-facto prime minister of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru called a meeting of senior Army Officers to select the first General of the Indian army.

Nehru proposed, "I think we should appoint a British officer as a General of The Indian Army, as we don't have enough experience to lead the same." 
Having learned under the British, only to serve and rarely to lead, all the civilians and men in uniform present nodded their heads in agreement.

However one senior officer, Nathu Singh Rathore, asked for permission to speak. Nehru was a bit taken aback by the independent streak of the officer, though, he asked him to speak freely.
Rathore said, "You see, sir, we don't have enough experience to lead a nation too, so shouldn't we appoint a British person as the first Prime Minister of India?"

You could hear a pin drop.

After a pregnant pause, Nehru asked Rathore, "Are you ready to be the first General of The Indian Army?"........ Rathore declined the offer saying "Sir, we have a very talented army officer, my senior, Lt. Gen. Cariappa, who is the most deserving among us."

This is how the brilliant Gen. Cariappa became the first General and Rathore the first ever Lt. General of the Indian Army.

15/05/15, 7:36 PM - Pornima Akka: Why, I will not waive my gas subsidy

Mangalore Today News Network

An Open Letter to the Prime Minister
By SUMITH S. RAO

Respected Sir:

You have asked the rich and affluent people of India to waive off their share of subsidy on gas cylinders used by them in their homes and help in nation building.

I, for one would definitely prescribe to your view and gladly do so. In return, I would like all of you esteemed gentlemen and ladies who run our great country to also reciprocate our generous offer.

If only, every corporator, MLA, MP, and Minister could also waive off his gas subsidy, we the people of India would be very proud of you and salute you.

You would be setting an example to the citizens of India. Most of you have declared incomes running into a few crores while contesting the elections.

When will the day come when you will think of our poor brethren and waive off all the perks that you enjoy because of your position. 

When will you stop voting unanimously for a pay hike for yourselves, while bitterly fighting against all other issues in Parliament? 

When will we see you act as responsible citizens and fight over issues rather than take party based decisions?

Let me tell you, dear Sir, the Chancellor of a super power like Germany Ms. Angela Merkel rides on a public train to work, whereas in our country everyone from the Prime Minister, to the Members of Parliament, even down to the Zilla Panchayat President is allocated a car which is paid for from the coffers of our country which is filled generously by the tax payers money.

You incur thousands of rupees worth of telephone bills, electricity bills, free accommodation in luxury bungalows, avail free travel on public transportation, go on foreign jaunts on flimsy excuses and we the people of India pay for it.

When will you be a proud Indian and pay for all these facilities availed by you?

You get admitted to luxury hospitals for even a headache and especially when a probe is launched against you for any misdemeanor. Even there, you get the best beds and facilities free of charge.

Pray, tell me, Sir “When will you pay for these privileges?” 

You travel in air conditioned railway coaches and fly first class in planes even when you are not on official duty. It is us, the citizens of India who pay the fare for you.

Everyone, who is anybody, stakes his claim to fame by clamouring for “Z Class” security when the actual risk assessment for that person is zero. We, the people of India pay a fortune for your security. 

Alas, what a travesty of our times. That you who should be protecting the nation are being protected by the common man at his cost.

There are people in India who cannot even afford one meal a day and do not even have the strength to complain about it. Sadly, while you enjoy a cup of coffee bought at a princely sum of Rupees One or a full meal at Rupees Twelve at the Parliament canteen in air conditioned comfort and cannot be bothered about these trivial issues.

When shall you pay the full cost of a meal without passing on the bill to your countrymen?

Sir, I am just an ordinary citizen of India who dutifully pays his Income tax, Service Tax, Value Added Tax, Wealth Tax, Corporation Tax, Automobile Registration Tax and Property Tax which goes up to nearly 50 percent of our hard earned money while you enjoy the benefits of these taxes and live a privileged life because every citizen of India pays for your privileges.

The day all of you forego and waive all the unnecessary perquisites bestowed upon you by laws enacted by you would be a proud one in our nation’s history. 

The day, you gentlemen who have been elected to power by the people to govern our nation become responsible citizens of INDIA will be a milestone in our history. That day, all of us will definitely waive off our gas subsidy. 

Yours sincerely, 

An honest and dutiful citizen. 

Sumith S. Rao is a well known city based businessman and a former President of the District Small Scale Industries Association.

17/05/15, 8:09 AM - Paiya perrippa: இது கட்டுக் கதையல்ல. கண்ணீரால் நிறைந்த நிஜம். 
கர்ம வீரர் காமராசர் முதல்வராக இருந்த சமயம் நடந்தது. இவரல்லவோ முதல்வர்.
நேற்று வெளிவந்த தீர்ப்பு என்னை மிகவும் பாதித்தது.
பெண் என்று பாவப்படும் நண்பர்களே அவர் முதல்வராக 
இருந்த காலத்தில் செய்த குற்றம் அது. முதல்வர் என்பவர் மக்களைக் காப்பாற்றுபவர்.தவறே செய்யக்கூடாது.
நீதி என்பது எல்லோருக்கும் பொதுவானதாக இருக்கனும். 
இங்கு நிதி நீதியை கொன்று புதைத்துவிட்டது.
அந்த காலம் இப்படியும் இருந்தது என உறக்கமின்றி தவித்தேன்...
“அப்போது காமராஜர் முதல்வர். பழைய சட்டமன்ற விடுதியில் மண்ணாங்கட்டி என்பவர் கீழ்மட்ட ஊழியராக இருந்தார். சட்டமன்ற ஊறுப்பினர்கள் கேட்பதை வாங்கிவந்து தருவார். முதல் தளத்தில் முன்பாகவே இருக்கும் முக்கையா தேவர் அறையிலேயே இருப்பார். ’
ஒருமுறை ‘ஏம்பா மண்ணாங்கட்டி அவசரமாக வெளியில போறன். குளிச்சு முடிச்சு ரெடியாகுறதுக்குள்ள இட்லிய வாங்கி வந்துடு’ என்று 100 -ருபாயை கொடுத்தார் முக்கையா தேவர். சொன்னபடியே அவர் ரெடியாகி காத்திருந்தார்.
ரொம்ப நேரம் ஓடியது. தலையில் சுமையுடன் தட்டுதடுமாறி வந்தார் மண்ணாங்கட்டி. பார்த்ததும் ’ஏன்யா. நான் அவசரமா வெளியில போகனும்னு காத்துகிட்டு இருக்கேன். இட்லி வாங்க இவ்வளவு நேரமா என்று எகிறினார் மூக்கையா தேவர். மண்ணாங்கட்டிக்கு கோபம். என்னங்கய்யா நீங்க. இங்க உணவகத்தில் அவ்வளவு இட்லி இல்லைன்னு சொல்லிட்டாங்க. மவுண்ட் ரோடெல்லாம் போய் அலைஞ்சு
100 ரூபாக்கும் இட்லி வாங்குறது லேசுபட்ட காரியமா’என்று பதிலுக்கு சத்தம் போட்டார். அதுதான் மண்ணாங்கட்டி என்ற வெகுளி. அப்பாவி. அவ்வளவு வெள்ளந்தி....
அப்படியான மண்ணாங்கட்டியின் தலையில் ஒருநாள் இடி விழுந்தது. அந்த உத்தரவை படித்துகாட்டச்சொல்லி வீட்டில் அழுது புரண்டு கதறினார். ’அரசாங்க உத்தியோகத்தில் எழதப்படிக்கத் தெரியாதவர்கள் எல்லாம் இனி வேலையில் இருக்க கூடாது. பணியில் இருந்து நீக்கப்படுகிறார்கள்’ என்று காமராஜர் போட்ட உத்தரவுதான் அந்த கடிதம். இரண்டு நாள் கழித்து பழைய சட்டமன்ற உறுப்பினர் விடுதிக்கு ஓடிவந்தார். முக்கையா தேவரிடம் தரையில் விழுந்து கதறி அழுகிறார்.
என்னவென்று கேட்கிறார். ’இப்படி ஒரு உத்தரவு வந்திருக்கிறதே. என் குடும்பம் எல்லாம் நடுத்தெருவுக்கு வந்துடுச்சே. எப்படியாவது காப்பாத்துங்க ஐயா’ என்று பித்துப் பிடித்தவராக அழுகிறார். ஏதாவது சமாதானம் சொல்லனுமே என்று ’முதல்வர் ஆபிசுக்கு போன் போடுடா. கேட்டுடலாம்’ என்றார். அப்போது எல்லாம் நேரடியாக தொலைபேசும் வசதி இல்லை. ஆப்ரேட்டரிடம் கூறிவிட்டு காத்திருக்க வேண்டும். முதுல்வர் அலுவலகத்தில் யாராவது உதவியாளர் எடுப்பார்கள்.
மண்ணாங்கட்டி புக்செய்த நேரம் உடனே தொடர்பு கிடைத்தது. மறுமுனையில் முதல்வர் காமராஜ். யார் நீங்கள் உங்களுக்கு என்ன வேண்டும் என்கிறார். அய்யா நான்தான் அசம்பிளி ஆஸ்டல் பியூன் மண்ணாங்கட்டி பேசுறங்க ஐயா என்றபடியே அருகில் இருந்த முக்கையா தேவரை பார்க்கிறார். அவருக்கு முதர்வர் அலுவலகத்தில் இருந்து 
யாராவது உதவியாளர்கள்தான் டெலிபோனை எடுத்திருப்பார்கள் என்ற நினைப்பு. ‘எழுதப்படிக்க தெரியாதவங்க எல்லாம் முதல்வரா இருக்கறப்போ நான் பியூனா இருக்கக்கூடாதான்னு கேளுடா” என்கிறார்.
மறுமுனையில் இருந்த காமராஜரிடம் அதை அச்சுபிசகாமல் ‘ஐயா, எழுதப்படிக்க தெரியாதவங்க எல்லாம் முதல்வரா இருக்கிறப்போ நான் பியூனா இருக்ககூடாதான்னு’ தேவர் ஐயா கேட்க சொல்றாருங்க என்கிறார் மண்ணாங்கட்டி. பிறகு பேச்சில்லை....
அடுத்த 30 நிமிடத்தில் உயர் அதிகாரிகள் 3-பேர் அங்கே வந்துவிட்டார்கள். முதல்வருக்கு போன் செய்தது யார்? என்றார்கள். நான்தான் ஐயா என்று முன்னே வருகிறார் மண்ணாங்கட்டி. உங்களை கையோடு அழைத்துவரச் சொல்லியிருக்கிறார். உடனே புறப்படுங்கள் என்று நிற்கிறார்கள். அப்போதுதான் நாம் பேசியிருப்பது 
முதல்வர் காமராசர் என புரிகிறது. முக்கையா தேவருக்கும் பதட்டம். மண்ணாங்கட்டி ’ஐயா நீங்களும் வாங்க’ என்று அழுகிறார். பின்னாடியே வருகிறேன். நீ போப்பா என்று 
அனுப்பி வைக்கிறார். கோட்டையில் உள்ள முதல்வர் காமராஜை நோக்கி வாகனம் பறக்கிறது.
முதர்வரின் அறையில் உள்ள ஷோபாவில், கண்ணத்தில் கைவைத்தபடி கவலைதோய்ந்த முகத்தோடு உட்கார்ந்திருக்கிறார் காமராஜர். கதவு திறக்கப்படுகிறது. மண்ணாங்கட்டி முதலில் நுழைய அதிகாரிகள் சற்று ஒதுங்கி கதவோரம் நின்று கொண்டார்கள்.
நீங்கதான் மண்ணாங்கட்டியா...என்கிறார். ஆமாங்க ஐயா. 
நான் தெரியாம பேசிட்டேன். என்னை மன்னிச்சுடுங்க ஐயா என்றபடியே கீழே விழுந்தார். அந்த கலாச்சாரம் காமராஜருக்கு பிடிக்காது. அதிகாரிகளை பார்க்க உடனே எழுப்பி நிற்க வைக்கிறார்கள். அவரை வா...வாண்ணே. வந்து பக்கதில உட்காருங்க என்றழைக்கிறார். மண்ணாங்கட்டி தயங்கி நிற்கிறார். காமராஜர் முறைக்க தயங்கி தயங்கி பக்கத்தில் சென்று உட்காருகிறார்.
மண்ணாங்கட்டியை முதுகில் தட்டிக்கொடுத்து முகத்தையே உற்றுப்பார்த்த முதல்வர் காமராஜ், பட்டென்று கையெடுத்து கும்பிட்டு ‘நான் தப்புபன்னிட்டன். தெரியாம செய்திட்டன். மன்னிச்சுடு. அந்த தவறை நீதான் புரியவைச்சே...
ரெண்டு நாளா உங்கவீட்ல சோறுதண்ணியில்லியாமே. 
சமைக்கலயாமே....உங்களுக்கு ரெண்டு பொம்பள புள்ளைங்க...எல்லாத்தையும் இப்பதான் தெரிஞ்சுகிட்டேன்..எவ்வளவு பெரிய தப்பு செய்திருக்கேன்.. 
நான் அப்படி ஒரு உத்தரவு போட்டிருக்ககூடாது.
‘இனிமே புதிதாக வேலைக்கு வருபவர்களுக்கு எழுத படிக்க தெரிந்திருக்க வேண்டும்’னு போட்டிருக்க வேண்டும். நான் செய்தது தவறுதான் என்று தட்டிக்கொடுத்து ஆதறவு சொல்ல மண்ணாங்கட்டி கதறி அழுகிறார். காமராஜருக்கும் பேச்சு இல்லை...
அடுத்து அங்கேயே ஒரு உத்தரவு தயாராகிறது. காமராஜர் கையொப்பமிடுகிறார். மண்ணாங்கட்டிக்கு மீண்டும் அரசு வேலை. அதிகாரிகளை பார்த்து ‘இவரை அழைத்துக்கொண்டு போங்க. வேலை கொடுத்தாச்சு. இனி கவலைப்பாதீங்கன்னு அவரோட மனைவி, குழைந்தைங்ககிட்ட சொல்லுங்க’ன்னு அதிகார குரலில் உத்தரவிடுகிறார். பிறகென்ன நினைத்தாரோ சற்று தயங்கி ’போகிறபோது வெறும் கையோட போகாதீங்க. ஓட்டல்ல எல்லாருக்கும் சாப்பாடு வாங்கிட்டு போய் கொடுங்க. ரெண்டு நாளா அவர்கள் சாப்பிட்டிருக்க மாட்டர்கள்’ என கண்டிப்போடு கூறுகிறார் அந்த அதிகாரிகளிடம்.
மண்ணாங்கட்டிக்கு பேச வார்த்தைகளின்றி கையெடுத்து கும்பிட்டபடியே வெளியேற, முதர்வர் காமராஜரும் எழுந்தது கையெடுத்து கும்பிட்டபடியே அனுப்பிவைத்தார்.
ஒரு ஏழையின் கண்ணீர் வலி..இன்னொரு ஏழைக்குத்தான் தெரியும். ஆமாம் காமராஜர் ஏழையாகவே, எழை
மக்களுக்காகவே இருந்தார்....
இனி இதுபோல முதல்வர் கிடைப்பாரா என்ற ஏக்கத்தோடு...
பிடிச்சிருந்தா பகிருங்க நட்பூக்களே....
18/05/15, 8:21 AM - Pornima Akka: Ducks Quack, Eagles Soar

I was waiting in line for a ride at the airport. When a cab pulled up, the first thing I noticed was that the taxi was polished to a bright shine. Smartly dressed in a white shirt, black tie, and freshly pressed black slacks, the cab driver jumped out and rounded the car to open the back passenger door for me.

He handed me a laminated card and said: 'I'm Wasu, your driver. While I'm loading your bags in the trunk I'd like you to read my mission statement.'

Taken aback, I read the card. It said: Wasu's Mission Statement:
To get my customers to their destination in the quickest, safest and cheapest way possible in a friendly environment.

This blew me away. Especially when I noticed that the inside of the cab matched the outside. Spotlessly clean!

As he slid behind the wheel, Wasu said, 'Would you like a cup of coffee? I have a thermos of regular and one of decaf.'

I said jokingly, 'No, I'd prefer a soft drink.'

Wasu smiled and said, 'No problem. I have a cooler up front with regular and Diet Coke, lassi, water and orange juice.'

Almost stuttering, I said, 'I'll take a Lassi.'

Handing me my drink, Wasu said, 'If you'd like something to read, I have The Hindu, Times  of India, ET and India Today.'

As they were pulling away, Wasu handed me another laminated card, 'These are the stations I get and the music they play, if you'd like to listen to the radio.'

And as if that weren't enough, Wasu told me that he had the air conditioning on and asked if the temperature was comfortable for him.

Then he advised me of the best route to my destination for that time of day. He also let me know that he'd be happy to chat and tell me about some of the sights or, if I preferred, to leave me with my own thoughts.

'Tell me, Wasu,' I was amazed and asked him, 'have you always served customers like this?'

Wasu smiled into the rear view mirror. 'No, not always. In fact, it's only been in the last two years. My first five years driving, I  spent most of my time complaining like all the rest of the cabbies do. Then I heard about power of choice one day.'

'Power of choice is that you can be a duck or an eagle.'

'If you get up in the morning expecting to have a bad day, you'll rarely disappoint yourself. Stop complaining!' 

'Don't be a duck. Be an eagle. Ducks quack and complain. Eagles soar above the crowd.'

'That hit me right,' said Wasu. 

'It is about me. I was always quacking and complaining, so I decided to change my attitude and become an eagle. I looked around at the other cabs and their drivers. The cabs were dirty, the drivers were
unfriendly, and the customers were unhappy. So I decided to make some changes. I put in a few at a time. When my customers responded well, I did more.'

'I take it that has paid off for you,' I said.

'It sure has,' Wasu replied. 'My first year as an eagle, I doubled my income from the previous year. This year I'll probably quadruple it. My customers call me for appointments on my cell phone or leave a message on it.'

Wasu made a different choice. He decided to stop quacking like ducks and start soaring like eagles.

Have an eagle like life!

Brilliant, isn't it?

And look at this symmetry :
1 x 1 = 1
11 x 11 = 121
111 x 111 = 12321
1111 x 1111 = 1234321
11111 x 11111 = 123454321
111111 x 111111 = 12345654321
1111111 x 1111111 = 1234567654321
11111111 x 11111111 = 123456787654321
111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321

We will take  a COFFEE before we go?"

Read it......

A little Indian Boy wanted Rs50, so he prayed for weeks, but nothing happened.
Finally he decided to write a letter to God requesting Rs50.

When post office staff received a letter addressed to God, they forwarded it to the President.

... ... President was so amused, he instructed his secretary to send the little boy Rs 20, as he thought Rs50 would be a lot of money for him.

The little boy was delighted with Rs20 & decided to write a thank u note to God.

'Dear God, Thank u very much for sending the money. However,
I noticed that u have sent it through 'Rashtrapati Bhavan' (Through Government ) & those corrupt donkeys ate my 30 rupees! 😂😎😂
21/05/15, 5:26 PM - Paiya perrippa: Couldn't stop myself from forwarding this Excellent message .. 

A bus full of passengers was traveling while. suddenly the weather changed and there was a huge downpour and lightening all around.

They could see that the lightening would appear to come towards the bus and then go elsewhere.

After 2 or 3 horrible instances of being saved from lightening, the driver stopped the bus about fifty feet away from a tree and said -

"We have somebody in the bus whose death is a certainty today."

Because of that person everybody else will also get killed today.

Now listen carefully what I am saying ..

I want each person to come out of bus one by one and touch the tree trunk and come back.

Whom so ever death is certain will get caught up by the lightening and will die & everybody else will be saved".

They had to force the 1st person to go and touch the tree and come back.

He reluctantly got down from the bus and went and touched the tree.

His heart leaped with joy when nothing happened and he was still alive.

This continued for rest of the passengers who were all relieved when they touched the tree and nothing happened.

When the last passenger's turn came, everybody looked at him with accusing eyes.

That passenger was very afraid and reluctant since he was the only one left.

Everybody forced him to get down and go and touch the tree.

With a 100% fear of death in mind, the last passenger walked to the tree and touched it.

There was a huge sound of thunder and the lightening came down and hit the bus - yes the lightening hit the bus, and killed each and every passenger inside the bus.

It was because of the presence of this last passenger that, earlier,the entire bus was safe and the lightening could not strike the bus.

LIFE LEARNING from this..

At times, we try to take credit for our present achievements, but this could also be because of a person right next to us.

Look around you - Probably someone is there around you, in the form of Your Parents, Your Spouse, Your Children, Your Siblings, Your friends, etc, who are saving you from harm..!







Think About it..

You will surely find that Person..!!

She told that she was was inspired by his intelligence  and wanted a son just like him. He replied that there are so many chances that they may not be able to marry and if married also they could be childless or they could have a  daughter . She asked what is the solution? He replied with a smile and told your wish will be fulfilled. How she asks? It is very simple, just accept me as your son from this minute.  That was vivekananda

Fears that it may be stolen.

Each mobile carries a unique

1. Dial *#06# from your mobile.

2. Your mobile shows a unique 
    15 digit.

3. Note down this no anywhere 
     But except in your mobile as 
     this is the Number which will 
     help trace your mobile in 
     Case of a theft.

4. Once stolen you just have to 
     E-mail this 15 digit IMEI No. 
     to cop@vsnl.net with detail 
     Mentioned below.
   
Your name:____________________
Address:______________________
Phone model:_________________
Make:_________________________
Last used No.:_________________
E-mail for communication:_____
Missed date:___________________
IMEI No :_______________________

      5. No need to go to the 
          police.

      6. Your Mobile will be traced 
           within next 24 hrs via a 
           complex system of GPRS 
          and internet, You will find 
          where your hand set is 
          being operated even in 
          case your No. is being 
          changed.

29/05/15, 6:56 AM - Paiya perrippa: 1949 ஆம் ஆண்டு. எனக்கு அப்போது
வயது 14. நான் 10 ஆம் வகுப்பு
படித்துக்கொண்டு இருந்தேன். அம்மா
என்னை அரிசி எடுத்து வருவதற்காக
சென்னையில் இருந்து காஞ்சிபுரம்
அனுப்பி இருந்தார். நான் காஞ்சிபுரத்
தில் இருந்து 10 கிலோ அரிசியை
எடுத்துக் கொண்டு பஸ்ஸில்
வந்தேன். அதற்கான அனுமதியையும்
பெற்று இருந்தேன்.
அப்போதையக் காலத்தில் குறிப்பிட்ட
எடைக்கு மேல் அரிசி மற்றும்
நெல்லை அனுமதி இல்லாமல் வேறு
இடங்களுக்கு எடுத்துச் செல்ல
அனுமதி மறுக்கப் பட்டிருந்தது.
(அப்போது சென்னையில் இருந்து
காஞ்சி புரத்துக்கு பஸ் கட்டணம் 1
ரூபாய் 25 காசுகள்)
சென்னையை நோக்கி வந்துகொண்டு
இருந்தது பஸ். ஆற்காடு
செக்போஸ்ட்டில் வந்தபோது பஸ்ஸை
நிறுத்தி அவரவர் கைகளில் இருந்தப்
பொருட்களை அதிகாரிகள்
பரிசோதனை செய்துகொண்டு
இருந்தனர். என்னைப் பரிசோதித்த ஓர்
அதிகாரி என் மடியில் இருந்த அரிசிப்
பையைப் பார்த்துவிட்டு, ‘பத்து கிலோ
அரிசியைக் கொண்டு செல்ல அனுமதி
வாங்கி இருக்கிறாயா?’ என்றார். நான்
அனுமதி வாங்கிய விவரத்தைச்
சொன்னேன்.
ஆனாலும், அந்த தாசில்தார் நான்
கொண்டுவந்த அரிசிப் பையைப்
பிடுங்கிக் கொண்டார். நான்
எவ்வளவோ எடுத்துச் சொல்லியும்
அவர் அரிசிப் பையைக்
கொடுக்கவில்லை. ‘எங்கள் வயலில்
விளைந்த அரிசி இது. பத்து கிலோ
எடுத்துச் செல்ல உரிய அனுமதி
வாங்கி இருக்கிறேன். அப்படியும்
நீங்கள் ஏன் தடுக்கிறீர்கள்?’ எனக்
குரலை உயர்த்தி நியாயம் கேட்டேன்.
அதில், அந்த தாசில்தாருக்கு
கடுமையான கோபம் வந்துவிட்டது.
‘என்னிடமே நியாயம் பேசுகிறாயா?
உன்னால் முடிந்ததைச் செய்துகொள்.
அரிசியைத் தர முடியாது. மீறிப்
பேசினால் போலீஸுக்குத் தகவல்
சொல்ல வேண்டி இருக்கும்!’ என
மிரட்டி அனுப்பிவிட்டார்.
எங்கள் குடும்பத்தில் அப்போது 11
பிள்ளைகள். நான் கொண்டுபோகும்
அரிசியில்தான் சாப்பாடு செய்ய
வேண்டிய நிலை. சில நேரங்களில்
அப்பா ஓவர் டியூட்டி பார்த்தாலும்
பார்ப்பார். வெறும் கையோடு
போனால் அம்மா என்ன செய்வாள்?
பலவித வேதனைகளும் மனதைக்
குழப்ப, அரிசிப் பையை இழந்துவிட்டு
வீட்டுக்கு வந்தேன்.
தாசில்தார் அரிசிப் பையைப்
பிடுங்கிக்கொண்ட விஷயத்தைச்
சொன்னேன். சொல்லும்போதே எனக்கு
அழுகை பொங்கியது. அப்போது
வீட்டுக்கு வந்த என் தந்தை, ‘சரி,
விடு. அதிகாரிகள் ஏதோ தவறான
அரிசின்னு நினைச்சுப் பிடிச்சிருப்பாங்க. அதை விட்டுத்தள்ளு. நான்
கடைக்குப்போய் அரிசி வாங்கி
வருகிறேன்’ என எனக்கு ஆறுதல்
சொல்லிக் கிளம்பிவிட்டார்.
ஆனால், என்னால் என்னை சமாதானம்
செய்துகொள்ள முடியவில்லை. ‘ஏதோ
ஓரளவுக்கு சமாளித்துக் கொள்ளும்
குடும்பம் என்பதால் சிக்கல்
இல்லாமல் போய்விட்டது. இதேபோல்
ஒரு அன்றாடங்காய்ச்சியின்
குடும்பத்துக்கு நேர்ந்து இருந்தால்
என்னாகி இருக்கும்?’ என்கிற எண்ணம்
அன்று முழுக்க என்னைத்
தூங்கவிடவில்லை. தவறாக
நடந்துகொள்வது எத்தகையக்
கண்டனத்துக்கு உரியதோ...
அதேபோல்தான் தவறைத் தட்டிக்
கேட்காமல் அலட்சியம் காட்டுவதும்.
அந்த ஆவேசம் எனக்குள் அடங்காதத்
தீயாகத் தகிக்கத் தொடங்கியது.
‘ஒரு தனி நபர் ஓர் ஊரிலிருந்து
அடுத்த ஊருக்கு எத்தனை கிலோ
அரிசியை எடுத்துச் செல்லலாம்?
அதற்கு யாரிடம் அனுமதி பெற
வேண்டும்?’ என்கிற விவரங்களை
எல்லாம் மறுபடியும் படித்துப்
பார்த்து தெரிந்துகொண்டேன்.
சட்டப்படி நான் 10 கிலோ அரிசியைக்
கொண்டு வந்ததில் எந்தத் தவறும்
இல்லை என்கிற நிறைவு எனக்கு
நிம்மதியைக் கொடுத்தது. நியாயமாக
நடந்தும் அரிசியைப் பறித்துக்கொண்ட
அந்த தாசில்தாரை நிச்சயம் சும்மா
விடக்கூடாது என்கிற ஆவேசமும்
எனக்குள் அடங்கிவிடவில்லை.
‘எப்போதடா விடியும்?’ எனப் புரண்டு
புரண்டுப் படுத்தேன். காலையில்
எழுந்த உடன் தபால் ஆபீஸுக்குப்
போனேன். மூன்று பைசாவுக்கு ஒரு
போஸ்ட் கார்ட் வாங்கினேன். எனக்கு
நடந்த அநீதியை அப்படியே எழுதி
அப்போதையக் காஞ்சிபுரம்
கலெக்டருக்கு அனுப்பினேன். ‘நிச்சயம்
எனக்கான நியாயம் கிடைக்கும்’
என்கிற நம்பிக்கையோடு
பள்ளிக்கூடம் சென்று விட்டேன்.
நான்கு நாட்கள் கழித்து, ஆற்காடு
சிக்னலில் என் அரிசியைப் பிடுங்கி
வைத்துக்கொண்ட அதே தாசில்தார்
எங்கள் வீட்டுக்கு முன், கையில்
அரிசிப் பையோடு நின்றுகொண்டு
இருந்தார். நான் அவரை பார்க்காதது
போல் வீட்டுக்குள் சென்றுவிட்டேன்.
‘தம்பி... தம்பி...’ என்றபடியே பதறிய
அவர், மாவட்ட ஆட்சியர் தன்னை
சஸ்பெண்ட் செய்துவிட்டதாகக்
கூறினார்.
‘‘உங்களோட அரிசிப்பை ஒரு
அரிசிகூடக் குறையாமல் இதோ
இருக்கு. நடந்தது தவறுதான்.
என்னைவிட எத்தனையோ வயசு
சின்னப் பையனான உங்ககிட்ட மனசு
வருந்தி மன்னிப்புக் கேட்டுக்கிறேன்’’
என்றார் கண்ணீரோடு.
அரிசிப் பையை என்னிடம் கொடுத்து,
‘‘நடந்த சம்பவத்தை மறந்து என்னை
மன்னிச்சிட்டதா நீங்க ஒரு கடிதம்
கொடுத்தாத்தான் மறுபடியும் நான்
தாசில்தார் உத்தியோகம் பார்க்க
முடியும். தயவு பண்ணி என்னை
மன்னிச்சிட்டதா ஒரு கடிதம் எழுதிக்
கொடுங்க தம்பி’’ என அவர் இரு
கைகளையும் உயர்த்திக் கும்பிட்டபடி
சொல்ல... எனக்கே ஒரு
மாதிரியாகிவிட்டது.
இது என் நியாயத்துக்கான வெற்றி
என சத்தம் போட்டுக் கத்த
வேண்டும்போல் இருந்தது.
வயதில் சிறுவனாக இருந்தாலும்,
எனக்கு நடந்த அநீதியை யாருடைய
துணையும் இல்லாமல் என்னால்
தட்டிக் கேட்க முடியும். அதற்கான
நியாயத்தைப் பெற முடியும் என்கிற
துணிச்சல் எனக்குள் முதல்
முறையாகப் பூத்தது. யாரையும்
அழவைத்து ரசிக்கும் குரூரம் எனக்கு
ஒருபோதும் இருந்தது இல்லை.
அதனால், ‘நடந்த தவறை தாசில்தார்
ஒப்புக்கொண்டார். என் அரிசிப்
பையையும் முறைப்படி திருப்பிக்
கொடுத்தார். இனி இதுபோல் அவர்
யாரிடமும் நடந்துகொள்ள மாட்டார்
என நம்புகிறேன். திருந்திய
மனநிலையில் இருக்கும் இவரை
சஸ்பெண்ட் நடவடிக்கையில் இருந்து
விடுவித்து உரிய பணியில் அமர
வைக்கலாம்!’ எனக் கடிதம் எழுதிக்
கொடுத்து அனுப்பினேன்.
அறிந்தோ அறியாமலோ தவறு
நிகழ்ந்துவிடுகிறது. அதன் பாதிப்பு
அறிந்து ஒருவர் மன்னிப்புக்
கேட்கும்போது, தவறைத்
திருத்திக்கொள்ளும் வாய்ப்பாக
அவரை மன்னிப்பதில் தவறே இல்லை.
மன்னிப்புதான் மனிதகுலத்தின் மைய
விளக்கு. அது தரும் சுடரில்தான்
இந்தப் பூமிப் பந்து சுற்றுகிறது.
தவறு செய்தவர்களைத் திருந்தச்
செய்வது மட்டுமே நம் கடமை.
14 வயதில் ஒரு தாசில்தாரையே
சஸ்பெண்ட் ஆக வைத்திருக்கிறேன்
என்றால், நியாயத்தின் அடிப்படை யில்
என்னால் எதையும் தைரியமாகச்
செய்ய முடியும் என்கிற நம்பிக்கை
அப்போதுதான் பிறந்தது. மனதுக் குள்
புது வெள்ளம் பாய்ந்ததுபோல் ஓர்
உற்சாகம். ஒரு சிறு எறும்பு
யானையின் காதுக்குள் புகுந்து
யானையைக் குப்புற சாய்த்தது
போன்ற நிறைவு.
மூன்று பைசா போஸ்ட் கார்டில்
எழுதப்பட்ட விஷயத்தை
அக்கறையோடு படித்து, உரியபடி
விசாரித்து, தவறு செய்த அதிகாரி மீது
நடவடிக்கை எடுத்த அந்தக்
கலெக்டர்தான் ‘அநியாயமாக நடக்கும்
எதையும் தட்டிக் கேட்கலாம்’ என்கிற
துணிச்சலை எனக்குள் வார்த்தவர்.
இன்றைக்கு ஜனாதிபதி பிரணாப்
முகர்ஜி மீது வழக்குப்போட்டு
அவருக்கு நோட்டீஸ் அனுப்புகிறேன்
என்றால்... அதற்கான தைரியம் அந்த
14 வயதில் உருவானது.

Man: And on top of it all off, when I got home ~I just want to soak my feet in my new foot massager & relax. BUT it wouldn’t work!!! Nothing went right today! Why did You do that?
😰
God: Let me see, the death angel was at your bed this morning & I had to send one of My Angels to battle him for your life. I let you sleep through that
😊
Man (humbled): OH
😔
GOD: I didn’t let your car start because there was a drunk driver on your route that would have hit you if you were on the road.
😊
Man: (ashamed)
😒
God: The first person who made your sandwich today was sick & I didn’t want you to catch what they have, I knew you couldn’t afford to miss work.
😊
Man (embarrassed): Okay
😒
God: Your phone went dead bcuz the person that was calling was going to give false witness about what you said on that call, I didn’t even let you talk to them so you would be covered.
😊
Man (softly): I see God
😒
God: Oh and that foot massager, it had a shortage that was going to throw out all of the power in your house tonight. I didn’t think you wanted to be in the dark.

But stay awake through a 3 hour movie?

Why are we so bored when we look at the HOLY BOOK,
♨
But find it easy to read other books?
☀♨
Why is it so easy to ignore a msg about God,
♨
Yet we forward the nasty ones?
☀
Why are Prayers getting smaller,
♨
But bars and clubs are expanding?
♨
Why is it so easy to worship a celebrity,
☀♨
But very difficult to engage with God?
💥♨
Think about it, are you going to forward this?
♨💥
Are you going to ignore it, cause you think you will get laughed at?
♨💥
Forward this to all your friends.
♨💥
80% of you won't forward this.

💬 Stay away from Anger..It hurts ..Only You!
💬 If you are right then there is no need to get angry,
💬 And if you are wrong then you don't have any right to get angry.
💬 Patience with family is love,
💬 Patience with others is respect.
💬 Patience with self is confidence and Patience with GOD is faith.
💬 Never Think Hard about thePAST, It brings Tears...
💬 Don't think more about the FUTURE, It brings Fear...
💬 Live this Moment with a Smile,It brings Cheer.
💬Every test in our life makes us bitter or better,
💬 Every problem comes to make us or break us,
💬 The choice is ours whether we become victims or victorious.
💬 Beautiful things are not always good but good things are always beautiful
💬 Do you know why God created gaps between fingers?
💬 So that someone who is special to you comes and fills those gaps by holding your hand.
💬 Happiness keeps You Sweet..But being sweet brings happiness.

Do 
Share it with all the Good People In ur Life.

05/06/15, 10:09 PM - Paiya perrippa: "நூடுல்ஸ் ஒரு குப்பை உணவு" 
ஒரு எச்சரிக்கை - ரிப்போர்ட்

2 நிமிடங்களில் நீங்கள் வேக வேகமாய்ச் சமைத்துத் தரும், ஆசையாய் ஆசை ஆசையாய் நம் வீட்டுக் குழந்தைகள் அள்ளிச் சாப்பிடும் நூடுல்ஸ் ஒரு குப்பை உணவு என்றால் நம்புவீர்களா?

நம்புங்கள் என்கிறார்...!
அகமதாபாத்தைச் சேர்ந்த நுகர்வோர் விழிப்பு உணர்வு மற்றும் ஆராய்ச்சி மையத்தின் தலைமைப் பொது மேலாளர் ப்ரீத்தி ஷா.

'இன்சைட்’ என்கிற நுகர்வோர் விழிப்பு உணர்வு இதழின் ஆசிரியராகவும் இருக்கிறார்.விளம்பரங்களால் இந்தியச் சந்தையை ஆக்கிரமித்து எண்ணற்ற வீடுகளில் காலை உணவாகிவிட்ட நூடுல்ஸ், உண்மையிலேயே சத்தான உணவுதானா என்று தெரிந்துகொள்ள விரும்பினார் ப்ரீத்தி ஷா. 

இந்திய அளவில் முன்னணியில் இருக்கும் 15 நிறுவனங்களின் நூடுல்ஸ்கள் இந்த ஆய்வுக்கு எடுத்துக்கொள்ளப்பட்டன.

நூடுல்ஸில் இவ்வளவு சத்துக்கள் இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று இந்தியாவில் இதற்கான அளவு மதிப்பீடுகள் ஏதும் இதுவரை வரையறுக்கப்படாததால், இங்கிலாந்தின் உணவுத் தரக் கட்டுப்பாட்டு முகமையின் அளவுகளை வைத்து இந்தத் தரச்சோதனை நடந்தது. 

இதில் வெளியான முடிவுகள் மூலமாகத்தான் அதிர்ச்சி வைத்தியம் கொடுத்திருக்கிறார் ப்ரீத்தி ஷா.

ஆய்வு சொல்லும் முடிவுகள்?

சோதனை செய்யப்பட்ட எந்த முன்னணி நிறுவனங்களின் நூடுல்ஸும் விளம்பரங்களில் காட்டப்படுவதுபோல ஏகப்பட்ட சத்துக்களை உள்ளடக்கியதாகவோ, குழந்தைகள் உடல் நலனுக்கு முற்றிலும் நன்மை பயப்பதாகவோ இல்லை.
அனைத்து நூடுல்ஸ்களிலும்அனுமதிக்கப்பட்ட அளவைக் காட்டிலும் எக்கச்சக்க மடங்கு அதிகமாக உப்பு மற்றும் கொழுப்பு உள்ளன.

100 கிராம் நூடுல்ஸில் 130 முதல் 600 மில்லி கிராம் வரை அனுமதிக்கப்பட்டசோடியம் அளவாகும்.
ஆனால், இந்தியாவில் விற்கப்படும் வெவ்வேறு நூடுல்ஸ் நிறுவனங்களின் தயாரிப்புகளில் 821 மில்லி கிராம் முதல் 1943 மில்லி கிராம் வரை சோடியம் இருந்திருக்கிறது. 

ஆனால் தேவையான மற்ற சத்துக்களோ சொல்வதைவிடக் குறைந்த அளவில்! மிகக் குறைந்த அளவுக்கே நார்ச்சத்து, புரதம், கால்சியம் ஆகியன உள்ளன.

இதனால் ரத்த நாளங்களில் கொழுப்பு படிதல், உயர் ரத்த அழுத்தம், உடல் பருமன் எனப் பல்வேறு ஆபத்துகளுக்கும்குழந்தைகள் ஆளாக நேரிடும்.

ப்ரீத்தி ஷா சொல்கிறார் ''ஆய்வு முடிவுகளைப் பார்த்தபோது அதிர்ந்துபோனேன். இது தொடர்பாக விளக்கம் கேட்டு 15 நிறுவனங்களுக்கும் ஆய்வு நிறுவனம் சார்பில் கடிதம் அனுப்பினோம்.
ஆனால், இதுவரை அந்தக் கடிதங்களுக்கு எந்த நிறுவனமும் பதில் அளிக்கவில்லை.

கம்பு, வரகு, சாமை, தினை, கேழ்வரகு என்று எவ்வளவோ சத்து மிக்க சிறுதானியங்கள் விளையும் மண் இது. ஆனால், அவற்றை எல்லாம் இருட்டடிப்பு செய்துவிட்டு, விளம்பரங்கள் மூலம் சந்தையைப் பிடிக்கும் பெருநிறுவனங்கள் இந்திய மக்களை குழந்தைப் பருவத்தில் இருந்தே அடிமைப்படுத்துகின்றன.

பெற்றோர்கள் இந்த விஷயத்தில் விழிப்பு உணர்வோடு இருக்க வேண்டும். குப்பை உணவின் மூலமாக ஏற்படும் வளர்ச்சி உண்மையானது அல்ல.
நாளை நம் குழந்தைகள் நிரந்தர நோயாளிகளாக நாமே காரணம் ஆகிவிடக் கூடாது'' என்றார் அக்கறையுடன். உண்மைதான்.

நண்பர்களே! ஒரு நடிகையின் போட்டோவை அதிகம் ஷேர் செய்யறோம் .தயவு செய்து இதை அதிகம் பேருக்கு ஷேர் செய்யுங்கள்...!
உங்கள் ஷேர் ஒரு உயிரை கூட காப்பாற்றலாம்!

11/06/15, 5:32 PM - Pornima Akka: Awesome one

 A keen  Indian state bank Manager left the job and applied for a salesman's job at London 's premier downtown department store. In fact, it was the biggest store in the world - you could get anything there.

 The boss asked him, "Have you ever been a salesman before?" "Yes sir, I was a salesman in India ", replied the lad. The boss liked the cut of him and said, "You can start tomorrow and I'll come and see you."

 The day was long and arduous for the young man, but he got through it. 

 And finally 6:00 PM came around. 

 The boss duly fronted up and asked, "How many sales did you make today?" 

 "Sir, Just ONE sale." said the young salesman. 
 "Only one sale?" blurted the boss. 

 "No! No! You see here, most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. 

 "If you want to keep this job, you'd better be doing better than just one sale. 

 By the way "How much was the sale worth?" 
 = 93300534.00 pounds" said the young man. 
 "What"," How did you manage that?" asked the flabbergasted boss. 

 "Well", said the salesman, "This man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. 
 Then I sell him new fishing rod and some fishing gear. 

 Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast. 

 So I told him he'd be needing a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that twenty-foot schooner with the twin engines. 

 Then he said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to our automotive department and sold him that new Deluxe 4X4 Blazer. 

 I then asked him where he'll be staying, and since he had not decided, I took him to camping department and sold him one of those new igloo 6-sleeper camper tents. 

 Then the guy said, while we're at it, I should throw in about $100 worth of groceries and two cases of beer. 

 The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, "You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook!"

 "No" answered the salesman, "He came in to buy a headache relief tablet and I convinced him that fishing is best remedy for headache."

 Boss - "You take my chair..."

Once he received a call from old age home....Mom very serious ..... please come to visit.

Son went  and saw mom very critical, on her dying bed.

He asked: Mom what can I do for you.

Mom replied... "Please install fans in the old age home, there are none.... Also put a fridge for betterment of food because many times I slept without food".

Son was surprised and asked: mom, while you were here you never complained, now you have few hours left and you are telling me all this, why?

Mom replied....."it's OK dear, I've managed with the heat, hunger & pain, but when your children will send you here, I am afraid you will not be able to manage

20/06/15, 11:30 AM - Pornima Akka: Take a tablet & smell it before eating. Now either cold or fever will subside in few hours; then another tablet without this smell is for the next.
20/06/15, 11:30 AM - Pornima Akka: Maybe its a silly answer 😜
20/06/15, 11:31 AM - Harish Kumaraswami: take half -half from each tablets finally u will get one for cold and one for fever
20/06/15, 11:33 AM - Pornima Akka: @ harish - I think ur answer is more appropriate
20/06/15, 11:33 AM - Harish Kumaraswami: Its also a guess poorni
20/06/15, 11:33 AM - Harish Kumaraswami: Not sure
20/06/15, 11:44 AM - Pornima Akka: Answer this if u can . . .

Sherlock Holmes was walking down the streets in the morning when he found many people gathered. They were circling a woman‘s dead body.

He examined the body & found a purse in which was her license. Her name was Anne & he called up her residence number. Her husband picked up the phone and Sherlock said, “Your wife is dead“.

“No way“, said the husband.

“Please come and confirm“, said Sherlock.

Husband said, “Ok“ & hung up.

After 10 mins husband came & he saw the body & started crying.

Sherlock looked at the police
 officer &  said, “ARREST THE HUSBAND!!!...HE IS THE MURDERER!!“

WHY?????
20/06/15, 12:08 PM - Harish Kumaraswami: Bcoz Sherlock did not say the location to the husband over phone
20/06/15, 12:08 PM - Harish Kumaraswami: But he reached the spot

22/06/15, 7:41 PM - natarajan ramu: OneDay..Yamraja came to a Man  and said:

"Hey, today is your last day!"

Man:- "But i'm not ready!".

Yamraja said:  "Well today your name is the first on my list...".

Man:- "Okay,  then why don't you take a seat
 and 
We will take  a COFFEE before we go?"

Yamraja:--"All right.. ".

Man. gave Yamraja  COFFEE  with sleeping pills in it. 
Yamraja finished COFFEE and fell into a deep sleep!!!

Man. ..took the list & removed his name from top of the list 
and put at the bottom of the list!
(We all would do the same)

When Yamraja woke up he said to the Man :  "Because you have been so nice to me, now I will start my job  from the BOTTOM of the list.." !!!  

Moral:

Whatever is written in your Destiny ... 
Will never change... no matter how much u try....


It's such meaningful so.....do read and forward it ........👍

24/07/15, 8:14 PM - Pornima Akka: 👬 Once upon a time, two young boys were playing on thin ice. As they were playing, one of them fell through that ice into the lake underneath. The other one tried hard and he couldn't reach his friend through that gap.

So he walked up🚶 to a🌳 tree, pulled and broke a branch of enormous size. He came back and started beating the ice and he saved his friend.

When the paramedics came and they were able to revive the kid, they were baffled and they couldn't understand that how did his friend break an enormous sized branch and then beat the ice and save his friend. They thought it was IMPOSSIBLE

Then the👴 old man who was standing there said, "I can tell you how he did it."

👪They said, "How? How he did it."

👴The old man said, 
"There was no one here to tell him that he can't do it.".

28/07/15, 5:10 AM - Paiya perrippa: One day Krishna & Arjuna were taking their usual walk, when they came across an old Brahmin begging, taking pity on his condition, Arjuna gave him a bag of gold coins.The man was overjoyed. On his way to home, he was robbed by a thief in the forest. He cursed his fate and the next day set off to beg again.Arjuna & Krishna saw him again & got to know his story. Arjuna once again took pity and gave him a large diamond.The man took it home and kept it in an old pot which had been unused for many years inorder to keep it safe and went to sleep.The next morning before he could wake up, his wife went to fetch water from the river & on her way back, she slipped and her pot broke. She immediately remembered the pot at home which lay unused and brought it to fill it with water. Just as she dipped the pot in to the river the diamond escaped the pot and went in to the river.When she returned home the Brahmin was desperately searching the house for the pot & when he saw it in his wife's hands, he got to know what had happened. Dejected with what had happened, he once again left to go begging.Once again Arjuna and Krishna saw him and when Arjuna heard of the unfortunate incident that had happened, he told Krishna ," I don't think this man is destined to be blessed at all, I don’t think I can help him anymore".Krishna then gave the man two pennies and the man took them and walked away.Arjuna then asked Krishna," My Lord, if gold coins and diamond could not change his condition, what good can two pennies do to him?".Krishna smiled and replied, "let us see".As the man walked home he was cursing his fate when he saw a fish that had just been caught by a fisherman and was struggling for its life, he took pity on it and thought to himself, " these two pennies cannot fetch me food anyway, let me at least save the life of this creature" and he purchased the fish and was about to throw it in the river when he saw that the breathlessness of the fish was caused due to some large obstruction in its mouth and when removed it , it was the very diamond he had lost in the river. He was overjoyed and started shouting "Look what I found! Look what I found".At this very time the thief that had robbed him in the forest was passing by and heard his shouts, he recognized the man and thought that man too recognized him and was thus shouting. Fearing that the Brahmin may take him to be executed, he rushed to him and begged for his forgiveness and returned all the gold coins he had stolen from him. The Brahmin was happy and walked away joyfully with all his wealth.He went straight to Arjuna to narrate the turn of events and thanked him for all his help and went away.Arjuna then asked Krishna,"My Lord, how is it that my gold and diamond could not help him but your meager two pennies did?.Krishna replied," when he had the gold and diamonds he was only thinking of himself and his needs, but when he had the two pennies he put the needs of another creature before his and so I took care of his needs.The truth is O Arjuna when you think of the pain and needs of others and work to help them, you are doing God's work and hence God Himself takes care of you". This is best example for all devotees.  Be in devotional service all the time.  Haribol. Hare Krishna !!!!!!

28/07/15, 11:20 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: Please take your time reading it...
29/07/15, 5:54 AM - Pornima Akka: What I will be remembered for.. my memory of the last day with the great Kalam sir...
It has been eight hours since we last talked – sleep eludes me and memories keep flushing down, sometimes as tears. Our day, 27th July, began at 12 noon, when we took our seats in the flight to Guhawati. Dr. Kalam was 1A and I was IC. He was wearing a dark colored “Kalam suit”, and I started off complimenting, “Nice color!” Little did I know this was going to be the last color I will see on him.
Long, 2.5 hours of flying in the monsoon weather. I hate turbulence, and he had mastered over them. Whenever he would see me go cold in shaking plane, he would just pull down the window pane and saw, “Now you don’t see any fear!”.
That was followed by another 2.5 hours of car drive to IIM Shillong. For these two legged trip of five hours we talked, discussed and debated. These were amongsthundreds of the long flights and longer drives we have been together over the last six years. 
As each of them, this was as special too. Three incidents/discussions in particular will be “lasting memories of our last trip”. 
First, Dr. Kalam was absolutely worried about the attacks in Punjab. The loss of innocent lives left him filledwith sorrow. The topic of lecture at IIM Shillong was Creating a Livable Planet Earth. He related the incident to the topic and said, “it seems the man made forces are as big a threat to the livability of earth as pollution”. We discussed on how, if this trend of violence, pollution and reckless human action continues we will forced to leave earth. “Thirty years, at this rate, maybe”, he said. “You guys must do something about it… it is going to be your future world”
Our second discussion was more national. For the past two days, Dr. Kalam was worried that time and again Parliament, the supreme institution of democracy, was dysfunctional. He said, “I have seen two different governments in my tenure. I have seen more after that. This disruption just keeps happening. It is not right. I really need to find out a way to ensure that the parliament works on developmental politics.” He then asked me to prepare a surprise assignment question for the students at IIM Shillong, which he would give them only at the end of the lecture. He wanted to them to suggest three innovative ways to make the Parliament more productive and vibrant. Then, after a while he returned on it. “But how can ask them to give solutions if I don’t have any myself”. For the next one hour, we thwarted options after options, who come up with his recommendation over the issue. We wanted to include this discussion in our upcoming book, Advantage India. 
Third, was an experience from the beauty of his humility. We were in a convoy of 6-7 cars. Dr. Kalam and I were in the second car. Ahead us was an open gypsy with three soldiers in it. Two of them were sitting on either side and one lean guy was standing atop, holding his gun. One hour into the road journey, Dr. Kalam said, “Why is he standing? He will get tired. This is like punishment. Can you ask a wireless message to given that he may sit?” I had to convince him, he has been probably instructed to keep standing for better security. He did not relent. We tried radio messaging, that did not work. For the next 1.5 hours of the journey, he reminded me thrice to see if I can hand signal him to sit down. Finally, realizing there is little we can do – he told me, “I want to meet him and thank him”. Later, when we landed in IIM Shillong, I went inquiring through security people and got hold of the standing guy. I took him inside and Dr. Kalam greeted him. He shook his hand, said thank you buddy. “Are you tired? Would you like something to eat? I am sorry you had to stand so long because of me”. The young lean guard, draped in black cloth, was surprised at the treatment. He lost words, just said, “Sir, aapke liye to 6 ghante bhi khade rahenge”. 
After this, we went to the lecture hall. He did not want to be late for the lecture. “Students should never be made to wait”, he always said. I quickly set up his mike, briefed on final lecture and took position on the computers. As I pinned his mike, he smiled and said, “Funny guy! Are you doing well?” ‘Funny guy’, when said by Kalam could mean a variety of things, depending on the tone and your own assessment. It could mean, you have done well, you have messed up something, you should listen to him or just that you have been plain naïve or he was just being jovial. Over six years I had learnt to interpret Funny Guy like the back of my palm. This time it was the last case. 
“Funny guy! Are you doing well?” he said. I smiled back, “Yes”. Those were the last words he said. Two minutes into the speech, sitting behind him, I heard a long pause after completing one sentence. I looked at him, he fell down. 
We picked him up. As the doctor rushed, we tried whatever we could. I will never forget the look in his three-quarter closed eyes and I held his head with one hand and tried reviving with whatever I could. His hands clenched, curled onto my finger. There was stillness on his face and those wise eyes were motionlessly radiating wisdom. He never said a word. He did not show pain, only purpose was visible. 
In five minutes we were in the nearest hospital. In another few minutes the they indicated the missile man had flown away, forever. I touched his feet, one last time. Adieu old friend! Grand mentor! See you in my thoughts and meet in the next birth. 
As turned back, a closet of thoughts opened. 
Often he would ask me, “You are young, decide what will like to be remembered for?” I kept thinking of new impressive answers, till one day I gave up and resorted to tit-for-tat. I asked him back, “First you tell me, what will you like to be remembered for? President, Scientist, Writer, Missile man, India 2020, Target 3 billion…. What?” I thought I had made the question easier by giving options, but he sprang on me a surprise. “Teacher”, he said. 
Then something he said two weeks back when we were discussing about his missile time friends. He said, “Children need to take care of their parents. It is sad that sometimes this is not happening”. He paused and said, “Two things. Elders must also do. Never leave wealth at your deathbed – that leaves a fighting family. Second, one is blessed is one can die working, standing tall without any long drawn ailing. Goodbyes should be short, really short”. 
Today, I look back – he took the final journey, teaching, what he always wanted to be remembered doing. And, till his final moment he was standing, working and lecturing. He left us, as a great teacher, standing tall. He leaves the world with nothing accumulated in his account but loads of wishes and love of people. He was a successful, even in his end. 
Will miss all the lunches and dinners we had together, will miss all the times you surprised me with your humility and startled me with your curiosity, will miss the lessons of life you taught in action and words, will miss our struggles to race to make into flights, our trips, our long debates. You gave me dreams, you showed me dreams need to be impossible, for anything else is a compromise to my own ability. The man is gone, the mission lives on. Long live Kalam.

06/08/15, 5:00 PM - Paiya perrippa: AN ABSOLUTE EPIC 

MYTHOLOGICAL / 21ST-CENTURY COCKTAIL-FUSION..

THE MAHABHARAT IS RELEVANT AT ALL TIMES.

"DURYODHAN & RAHUL GANDHI BOTH WITHOUT TALENT.. BUT YET WANTED TO BE RULER ON THE PRINCIPLE OF BIRTH-RIGHT...

BHISHMA & ADVANI NEVER GOT CROWNED... BUT YET GOT RESPECT & BECAME HELPLESS AT THE END OF LIFE...

ARJUN & NARENDRA BOTH TALENTED. REACHED THE HIGHEST POSITION DUE TO BEING ON THE DHARMA-SIDE...

KARNA & MANMOHAN BOTH TALENTED.. BUT NEVER REACHED ANYWHERE BCOZ OF BEING ON THE SIDE OF ADHARMA...

ABHIMANYU & KEJRIWAL BOTH NEW IN WAR.. THEY DID NOT PASS THE CHAKRAVYUH THAT ENEMIES HAD SPREAD & GOT TRAPPED SOMEWHERE OR THE OTHER...

SHAKUNI & DIGVIJAYSINGH BOTH WANTED THEIR MASTERS TO BE HAPPY.. IRRESPECTIVE OF TALENT...

DHRITRASHTRA & SONIA BOTH WERE BLIND FOR THEIR LOVE FOR SONS...

AND LAST IS KRISHNA,

Krishna is Shri Abdul Kalam. We celebrate both of them but do not follow a single word of what they have preached.
06/08/15, 5:02 PM - Paiya perrippa: This one is awesome😄👍👍👌.

A driver was stuck in a traffic jam on the road outside Parliament, Delhi.

Suddenly, a man knocks on the window.
The driver rolls down the window and asks,"What's going on?"
"Terrorists have kidnapped the entire  Indian politicians , and they're asking for a $100 million dollar ransom.
Otherwise, they're going to douse them all in petrol and set them on fire. We're going from car to car, collecting donations".

"How much is everyone giving, on an average?" the driver asks...

The man replies, "Roughly 2 litres."

07/08/15, 5:31 PM - Paiya perrippa: Charlie Chaplin told the audience a wonderful joke and all the people started laughing...

Chaplin repeated the same joke and only few people laughed..????

He again repeated the same joke but this time no one laughed...??????

Then he told these beautiful lines...;

" when you cannot laugh on the same joke again and again...
then why do you cry  again and again on the same worry"

So enjoy your every moment of life..!!
Life is beautiful??????
Today is Charlie Chaplin's 125th birthday - a good day to recollect his 3 heart-touching statements:-

(1) Nothing  permanent in this world, not even our troubles.

(2) I like walking in the rain, because nobody can see my tears.

(3) The most wasted day in life is the day in which we have not laughed.

Keep smiling and pass this message to everyone whom you want to see smiling...☺
Be happy😄😄😄😄

2500 books
1 flat (which he has donated)
1 Padmashri

Who'd have ever thought and these young, white American men do it so beautifully and this is a nearly flawless rendition. So proud of these folks … I am amazed at how meticulously they've grasped the svarās (intonations), especially knowing how much harder it would be with an American accent as a starting point.

Today China is the under the threat of economical slump. So china has devaluated its currency by 30%. According to the global economists, china will face economical slowdown by decreasing the prices of products by its domestic industries . so Chinese products will be available in very cheaper rate in Indian and other markets.
     But this is time to weaken Chinese economy, which we can do. Coz India is the biggest market for the china across the globe. China is making the buiesness of 6.2 million crore of Indian rupees per annum by Indian market.
       And as we know china is claiming on Indian territory and acquiring border areas,It seems that china is in war stance with India. Also China is supporting Pakistan indirectly to counter India to become a sub-continental leader.
       Hence this is the time to crush Chinese economy, hence I am requesting to each and every Indian that Do not buy any Chinese product for upcoming one month at least. It will be great if you will not buy product ever which is Made in China.Even here to make an appeal to all Indian Merchants and retailers that plz do not make business by Chinese products for upcoming one month as those products are going to be more cheaper.
       This is the time to slap china and to become A Patriotic Indian. Lets do it for Nation.
Guys,India is having 37% of wattsapp users out of its total population ( source: Gadget of telecommunications),out which 92% users are youngsters. We are sharing tonnes of useless messages daily. But as much as you spread this message ,that much will be the useful to your future itself.We should avail each n every chance to counter against the powerful enemy like China.
     As the responsible citizen of The Republic of India, I am requesting you to make this message viral. Do not miss a single contact from your phone book.
      Your deed of not buying Chinese products and to tell the same to others is equally important to the Nation as the service by An Indian Soldier on our boarders!

08/09/15, 9:25 PM - Vidya Perima: 🐜எறும்பினை கொல்வது எப்படி?🐜

 

முதலில் சர்க்கரையுடன் 🍲மிளகாய் பொடியை நன்றாக கலந்து, அதை எறும்பு புற்றின் அருகே வைக்கவும்.🍛

🍶🍺காரமான சர்க்கரையை சாப்பிட்டதால் நீர் அருந்த தண்ணீர் தொட்டியை தேடி எறும்பு வரும். அப்போது தெரியாமல் பின்னால் இருந்து தொட்டிக்குள் தள்ளி விடவும்.🛁🛁

🏊தண்ணீரில் மூச்சு திணறினாலும் சமாளித்து மேலே வரலாம்.🏊

🔥🔥அப்படி தப்பித்து வந்தால், உடல் நனைந்ததால், ஈரத்தை காய வைக்க அது நெருப்பை தேடி வரும்.🔥

💣அந்த நேரம் நெருப்பில் வெடிகுண்டை போடவும்.💣

😪😥அந்த வெடிகுண்டு வெடித்ததில் எறும்புக்கு பலத்த காயம் ஏற்படலாம்.

அப்போது அதை மருத்துவமனையில் சேர்க்கவும்.💉

💊தீவிர சிகிக்சை பிரிவில் கண்காணிக்கவும்.

ஒளிந்து நின்று யாருக்கும் தெரியாமல் எறும்புக்கு வைத்து இருக்கும் ஆக்சிஜன் மாஸ்க்கை எடுத்து விடவும்.🎭

🐜இப்போது மூச்சு காற்றுக்கு திணறும் எறும்பு தானாகவே சாகலாம்.😩

☁☁அப்படி சாகாவிடில், தலையணையை எடுத்து அதன் மேல் வைத்து அழுத்தினால் நிச்சயம் சாக வாய்ப்புண்டு.💀💀

🙇🙇(படித்து விட்டு கழுவி ஊத்தக்கூடாது அப்படி செய்தால் நாளை 
"பாக்டீரியாவை" கொல்வது எப்படினு போடுவேன்...!!!)🐙🐙😀😜

11/09/15, 8:26 PM - natarajan ramu: There was a king he had 10 wild dogs...
He used them to torture and eat all ministers who made mistakes.

So one of the minister’s once gave an opinion which was wrong, and which the king didn’t like at all… 
So he ordered that the minister to be thrown to the dogs.

So the minister said, 
"I served you 10 years and you do this..?

Pease give me 10 days before you throw me in with those dogs!
So the king agreed… 

In those 10 days the minister went to the guard that was guarding the dogs and told him he wants to serve the dogs for the next 10 days… 

The guard was baffled… 
But he agreed… 
So the minister started feeding the dogs, cleaning for them, washing them, providing all sorts of comfort for them.

So when the 10 days were up… 

The king ordered that the minister be thrown in to the dogs for his punishment. 

But when he was thrown in, 

Everyone was amazed at what they saw..
They saw the dogs licking the feet of the minister!

So the king baffled at what he saw… Said:” what happened to the dog. !!!” 

The minister then said;” 
I served the dogs for 10 days and they didn’t forget my service…
Yet I served you for 10 years and you forgot all at the first mistake!”… 

So the king realised his mistake 

and 
















Got crocodiles instead 😂

Interesting read

May be Two years back....one of the proud school in Chennai where all felt admission is impossible!!!

To get UKG admission for my friend's daughter I too went there. For that admission my friend had studied a lot than his daughter .

The child could not understand why they have brought her there. Principal of the school is like "kadalora kavithai Jenifer" (one of the filmy characters). When I smiled at her, she turned & that moment my friend realized there is no benefit by my presence .

When we all were standing, the school principal started to converse with the child....yes in English only. This is one of the most memorable interview I have ever witnessed in my life..

"What's your name?"

"Sarithra"

"Good. Tell me something you know"

"I know many things. Tell me what you want"

Alas, there is no better point for not getting the admission. .Sarithra's mother was trying to make up the situation but Jenifer stopped..

Turning to child,Jenifer said.. "Tell any rhymes or story which you know"

Again,"Which one you want Rhymes or Story?"

Well done, second wicket too gone. Jenifer was little bit angry about the reply

"Ok. .tell me a story"

"You want to hear what I studied or what I wrote"

Taken to surprise, Jenifer asked "Oh you write stories???"

"Why should I not write?"

Now even I was taken aback and whispered to my friend "our whole generation is not going to get admission in this school."

But Jenefier was impressed with the answer. She & including us, would have not heard such a story in our life.

Ok, tell me story which you have written

Sarithra said "Ravanan kidnapped Sita to Srilanka"

Opening scene failed to impress Jenifer but still she encouraged the child to continue

"Rama asked Hanumanâs help to rescue Sita. Hanuman too agreed to help Rama "

"Then?"

"Now, Hanuman called his friend Spider man." No one expected this twist in the story

"Why?"

"Because there are lot of mountains between India and Srilanka..if we have Spiderman we can go easily with his rope."

"But Hanuman can fly isn't it??"

"Yes. But he is having Sanjeevi Mountain on one hand so he cannot fly very fast. "

(I remember Hanuman's picture in ABT parcel service)

Now Jenifer is quiet, after a while Sarithra asked "Should I continue or not?.".

"Ok ok then."

"Hanuman and Spiderman flew to Srilanka and rescued Sita. Sita said Thanks to both"

"Why"

"When you are helped you should say Thanks"

"Ok Ok then."

"Hanuman now called Hulk."

All were surprised.She realized our curiosity and said " Now Sita is there, so to take her safely back to Rama..he called Hulk"

"What logic???" Jenifer asked.

"Hanuman can carry Sita right?"

"Yes. But he has Sanjeevi Mountain in one hand and has to hold spider man on the other"

Jenifier could not control her smiles. " So when they all started to India they met my friend Akshay"

"How come Akshay there now?"

"Because its my story and I can bring any one there"

Now Jenifer didn't get angry but waited for the next twist

Then all started to India and landed at Chennai Velechery bus stop

Now I asked,"Why they have landed In Velechery bus stop? "

"Because they forgot the way..& Hulk got an idea and called Dora"

I came to know about Dora only there.

"Dora came and she took Sita to Velechery Venus Colony...that's all." Finished the story with a smile

Now Jenifer asked "Why venus Colony?"

"Because sita is there & am Sita!!!"

Jenifer was impressed and embraced the child. She has been admitted in UKG & was gifted with a Dora doll.
😂😂😂
Really, kids can really amaze. Sometimes, we clip their wings (read creativity) by expecting them to do things as we see it right.

20/09/15, 8:45 PM - Paiya perrippa: CONVERSATION WITH Lord AlmIghty ..

Me- I can’t find free time. Life has become hectic.

GOD : Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free.

Me :why has life become complicated now?

GOD : Stop analyzing life.. It makes it complicated. Just live it.

Me : Why are we then constantly unhappy?

GOD : Worrying has become your habit. That’s why you are not happy.

Me: why do good people always suffer?

GOD : Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don’t suffer. With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.

Me : You mean to say such experience is useful?

GOD : Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards.

Me : Because of so many problems, we don’t know where we are heading…

GOD : If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.

Me : does failure hurt 
more than moving in the right direction?

GOD : Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you.

Me : In tough times, how do you stay motivated?

GOD : Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.

Me : What surprises you about people?

GOD : When they suffer they ask, “why me?” When they prosper, they never ask “Why me?”

Me : How can I get the best out of life?

GOD : Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.

Me : One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.

GOD  : There are no unanswered prayers. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.

23/09/15, 6:48 PM - Paiya perrippa: A very interesting management lesson 😊

A father left 17 Camels as an Asset for his Three Sons.

When the Father passed away, his sons opened up the will.

The Will of the Father stated that the Eldest son should get Half of 17 Camels,

The Middle Son should be given 1/3rd of 17 Camels,

Youngest Son should be given 1/9th of the 17 Camels,

As it is not possible to divide 17 into half or 17 by 3 or 17 by 9, the sons started to fight with each other.

So, they decided to go to a wise man.

The wise man listened patiently about the Will. The wise man, after giving this thought, brought one camel of his own & added the same to 17. That increased the total to 18 camels.

Now, he started reading the deceased father’s will.

Half of 18 = 9.
So he gave 9 camels
to the eldest son.

1/3rd of 18 = 6.
So he gave 6 camels
to the middle son.

1/9th of 18 = 2.
So he gave 2 camels
to the youngest son.

Now add this up:
9 + 6 + 2 = 17 &
This leaves 1 camel,
which the wise man took back.

MORAL: The attitude of negotiation & problem solving is to find the 18th camel i.e. the common ground. Once a person is able to find the common ground, the issue is resolved. It is difficult at times.

However, to reach a solution, the first step is to believe that there is a solution. If we think that there is no solution, we won’t be able to reach any!

A man checked into a hotel. There was  a computer in his room, so he decided to send a mail to his wife.  he accidentally typed d wrong email address, and without realizing he sent the mail to a widow who has just returned from her husband's funeral. The widow decided to check her mail, expecting condolence messages from relatives and friends. After reading d first message she fainted. The son rushed into d room, found his mother on the floor and saw d computer screen which read: 
'to my loving wife, i knw u are surprised to hear from me, they hv computers here and we are allowed to send mails to loved ones. I 've just been checked in.

Management Lessons from a Five Hundred Rupee Note
Prakash Iyer, MD, Kimberly-Clark Lever and Executive Coach from Pune shares two important management lessons he learnt from a 500-rupee note.
1.
I was in an audience listening to a motivational guru.
He pulled out a 500-rupee note.
Holding it up, he asked, "Who wants this 500-rupee note?"
Lots of hands went up. Including mine.
A slow chorus began to build as people began to shout "Me!" "Me!"
I began to wonder who the lucky one would be who the speaker would choose.
And I also secretly wondered -- and I am sure others did too -- why he would simply give away 500 rupees.
Even as the shouts of "I want it" grew louder, I noticed a young woman running down the aisle.
She ran up onto the stage, went up to the speaker, and grabbed the note from his hand. "Well done, young lady," said the speaker into the microphone.
"Most of us just wait for good things to happen. That's of no use. You've got to make things happen."
The speaker's words have stayed with me ever since.

'Simply thinking about doing something is of no use'

Our lives are like that. We all see opportunities around us. We all want the good things.
But the problem is we don't take action.
We all want the 500-rupee notes on offer but we don't make the move. Get up, and do something about it. Don't worry about what other people might think. Take action.

2. Several years later, it was another day, another time and another motivational guru.
As I watched him pull out a 500-rupee note and hold it up for all to see. I thought I knew what he was going to do next. But he just asked a simple question. "How much is this worth?"
"Five Hundred rupees!" the crowd yelled in unison.
"Right," said the speaker. He then took the note and crumpled it into a ball and asked "How much is it worth now?"
"500 rupees!" screamed the audience.
He then threw the note on the ground, stamped all over it and picked up the note and asked one more time: "And how much is it worth now?"
"500 rupees!" was the response.
"I want you to remember this," said the speaker.
"Just because someone crumples it, or stamps on it, the value of the note does not diminish.
We should all be like the 500 rupee note.
In our lives, there will be times when we feel crushed, stamped over, beaten. But never let your self-worth diminish. Just because someone chooses to crush you -- that doesn't change your worth one bit!
Don't allow your self-worth to diminish because someone says something nasty -- or does something dirty -- to you."

'Never let your self-worth diminish

து. இது எதிர்காலத்தில் 20 சதவீதமாக கூட உயரலாம் என டாக்டர்கள் அச்சம் தெரிவிக்கின்றனர்.
புகைப்பிடிப்பவர்களுக்கே அதிகம் :
அதே போல் உலகில் மாரடைப்பால் மரணமடைபவர்களில் 20 சதவீதம் பேர் புகைபிடிப்பவர்கள். புகை பிடிக்காதவர்களை விட புகைபிடிப்பவர்க
ளுக்கு இருதய நோய் வரும் வாய்ப்பு இரண்டு மடங்கு அதிகம். புகை பிடிப்பதனால் இருதயத்துக்கு செல்லும் ஆக்சிஜன் அளவு குறைகிறது. புகை பிடிப்பவர்களுக்கு மட்டும் இதனால் பாதிப்பு என்றில்லை. அவர்களை சுற்றியுள்ளோரும் குறிப்பாக குழந்தைகள் இதனால் பாதிக்க படுகின்றனர். நியுயார்க்கில் புகை பிடிக்க கட்டுப்பாடுகள் விதிக்கப்பட்ட பிறகு இருதய நோயால் பாதிக்கப்பட்டவர்கள் எண்ணிக்கை 8 சதவீதம் குறைந்திருக்கிறது. இந்தியாவிலும் இது போன்ற கட்டுப்பாடுகள் தேவை என டாக்டர்கள் வலியுறுத்துகின்றனர். இல்லையெனில் 2020ல் உலகிலேயே அதிக இருதய நோயாளிகளை கொண்ட நாடு இந்தியாவாக இருக்கும் என அவர்கள் எச்சரிக்கின்றனர்.உடல் பருமனாதலாலும், சர்க்கரை நோய் காரணமாகவும் இருதய நோய்கள் ஏற்படலாம் என கண்டறியப் பட்டுள்ளது. சர்க்கரை நோயால் இருதயத்துக்கு செல்லும் ரத்தக்குழாய்கள் சேதமடைவதால் மாரடைப்பு ஏற்படலாம். சர்க்கரை நோயாளிகளில் 75 சதவீதம் பேருக்கு இந்த குறைபாடு இருக்கிறது. இதனால் இவர்களுக்கு மாரடைப்பு ஏற்படும் வாய்ப்பு அதிகரித்திருக்கிறது. எனினும் சர்க்கரை நோயாளிகளுக்கு இருதய நோயை எளிதில் கண்டறிய முடிவதில்லை.

*உப்பு அதிகளவில் பயன்படுத்துவதால் உடலில் ரத்தக்கொதிப்பு அதிகரிக்கும். இதன் மூலம் இதய நோய் ஏற்படும் வாய்ப்பு அதிகரிக்கிறது.
*ரத்தத்தில் கொலஸ்ட்ரால், சர்க்கரை, பிபி போன்றவற்றின் அளவை சீரான அளவில் வைத்திருக்க வேண்டும்.
*ஒரு நாளுக்கு சராசரியாக 10 ஆயிரம் அடிகள் நடக்க வேண்டும்.
*காய்கறிகள் அதிகளவில் எடுத்துக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்.
*கொழுப்பு இல்லாத இறைச்சி, மீன், ஆலிவ் எண்ணெய், மக்காச்சோளம், சூரிய காந்தி எண்ணெய் வகைகள் இருதயத்துக்கு பாதுகாப்பளிக்கின்றன.
*சிரிக்கும் பழக்கத்தை வளர்த்துக்கொள்வது, இதய நோயிலிருந்து விடுபடுவதற்கு சிறந்த மருந்து.

29/09/15, 5:32 PM - Pornima Akka: Long Read....but worth reading 



At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves children with learning disabilities, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question:
 
'When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does, is done with perfection.

Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do.

Where is the natural order of things in my son?'

The audience was stilled by the query.

The father continued. 'I believe that when a child like Shay, who was mentally and physically disabled comes into the world, an opportunity to realise true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.'

 
Then he told the following story:

Shay and I had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, 'Do you think they'll let me play?' 

I knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but as a father I also understood that if my son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.

I approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, 'We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'

Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. I watched with a small tear in my eye and warmth in my heart. The boys saw my joy at my son being accepted.
 
In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs, but was still behind by three.

In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as I waved to him from the stands.

In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again.

Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.

At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?

Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.

However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognising that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact.

The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed.

The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.

As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.

The game would now be over.

The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman.

Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.

Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates.

Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, 'Shay, run to first! Run to first!'

Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base.

He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.

Everyone yelled, 'Run to second, run to second!'

Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base.

By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball. The smallest guy on their team now had his first chance to be the hero for his team.

He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.

Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.
All were screaming, 'Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'. 

Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, 'Run to third! Shay, run to third!'

As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on their feet screaming, 'Shay, run home! Run home!'

Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his team. 
 
'That day', said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, 'the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world'.

Shay didn't make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making me so happy, and coming home and seeing his mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!

AND NOW A LITTLE FOOT NOTE TO THIS STORY:

We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realise the 'natural order of things.

Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?

A wise man once said, "Every society is judged by how it treats it's least fortunate amongst them".

03/10/15, 6:11 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: Why avatars or mahapurushs are not taking birth nowadays?
Because it is Kaliyug, 
what is Kaliyug and what will happen during Kaliyug asked The four Pandavas (except Yudhishthira who was not present) 
Krishna smiled and said "let me demonstrate you the situation of Kaliyug" he took a bow and four arrows and shot them in four directions, and ordered the four Pandavas to bring them back.
Each of the four Pabdavas went in four different directions to search for the arrows.
Arjuna when picked the arrow heard a very sweet voice he turned back and saw a cuckoo was singing bhajans in very spellbinding voice but was also eating flesh of a live rabbit which was in great pain. Arjuna was very surprised to see such a gory act by such a divine bird he left the place immediately.
Bhima picked arrow from a place where five wells were situated, the four wells were surrounding a single well. The four wells were overflowing with very sweet water as if they were not able to hold water and surprisingly the well in the middle of these four overflowing wells was completely empty. Bhima was also puzzled at this sight.
Nakula was returning to the place after picking up the arrow he stopped at a place where a cow was about to give birth. After giving birth the cow started licking the calf but continued to lick it even after the calf was clean, with great difficulty people were able to separate them and by that time the calf was injured badly. Nakula was puzzled by the behaviour of such calm animal.
Sahdev picked arrow which fell near a mountain and saw a big boulder falling, the boulder was crushing the rocks and big trees on his way down, but the same boulder was stopped by a small plant. Sahdev was also amazed at this sight.
All the Pandavas asked the meaning of these incidents from Krishna who smiled and started explaining
" In Kaliyug the priests will have very sweet voice and will also have great knowledge but they will exploit devotees the same way cuckoo was doing with rabbit. In Kaliyug poor will live among rich, those rich will have enormous amount of wealth which will actually overflow but they will not offer a single penny to the poor same as the four well didn't had a single drop of water for the empty well. 
In Kaliyug parent will love their children so much that their love will actually spoil them and will destroy their lives similar to the love shown by cow to her newborn calf.
In Kaliyug people will fall in terms of character like the boulder from the mountain and they will not be stopped by anyone at the end only the name of God will be able to hold them from doom like the little plant held the boulder from further fall.
That's explanation of Kaliyug from Lord Krishna to Pandavas

04/10/15, 5:30 PM - natarajan ramu: மனைவி அமைவதெல்லாம் ::

சாதாரணமாக, மனைவிக்குப் பயப்படும் ஆண்களைப் பற்றி நிறைய நகைச்சுவை கதைகள் உண்டு. 

இதோ, அவற்றுள் ஒன்று :-

எமதர்ம மகாராஜன் ஒருமுறை பூமிக்கு வந்தபோது அழகான ஒரு பெண்ணிடம் தன் மனதைப் பறிகொடுத்தான். அவள் மானுடப் பெண் என்றாலும் அவளை மணந்து சில காலமாவது வாழ வேண்டும் என்ற ஆசை அவருக்கு வந்தது.

அதே மானுடப் பெண்ணை மணந்து அழகான ஆண் பிள்ளைக்கு தகப்பனார் ஆனார் எமதர்மன். அவர் மணந்த பெண் நல்லவள் தான். என்றாலும் நாளாக நாளாக எமனுக்கு அவள் மீது சலிப்பு தட்டியது. மேல் உலகம் போய் தப்பி விடலாமா என்று நினைக்க ஆரம்பித்தார். ஆனால் பிள்ளை மேல் இருந்த பாசத்தால் மகனை நிர்க்கதியாக விட்டுப் போக மனமும் வரவில்லை. தத்தளித்தார்.

மகன் கொஞ்சம் வளர்ந்ததும் மனம் விட்டு அவனிடமே பேசினார். அவனுடைய அம்மாவிடம் தனக்குள்ள பயத்தையும் விளக்கினார். 

"மகனே.. நீ சிறந்த வைத்தியனாக வேண்டும். மரணத் தருவாயில் இருப்பவரைக் கூட நீ காப்பாற்ற முடியும். எப்படித் தெரியுமா? 

ஒருவர் மரணம் அடைவதாக இருந்தால் நான் அங்கு இருப்பேன். உனக்கு மட்டும் கண்ணுக்குத் தெரிவேன். நான் அங்கு இருந்தால் அவருக்கு வைத்தியம் செய்யாதே! நீ வைத்தியம் செய்து அவர் இறந்து போனால் உன் புகழ் குறையும். எனவே, யாருக்கு வைத்தியம் செய்தாலும் நான் அங்கு இல்லையென்றால் தைரியமாக மருந்து கொடு. அவன் பிழைத்து எழுந்து கொள்வான். அதனால் உன் புகழ் மேலும் மேலும் பரவும்" என்றார் எமன். மனைவியிடம் சொல்லிக் கொள்ளாமல் மகனை அணைத்து கண்ணீர் விட்டு எமதர்மன் நழுவி விட்டார்.

மகன் மருத்துவம் படித்து மகத்துவம் பெற்றான். அவன் வைத்தியம் செய்தால் எப்படியிருப்பவனும் பிழைத்துக் கொண்டான். ஒருவர் கூடச் இறக்கவில்லை. எல்லோரும் ஆச்சர்யப்பட்டார்கள். யாருக்காவது வைத்தியம் செய்யப் போகும் போது எதிரில் அப்பாவை (எமனை)ப் பார்த்தால், கும்பிட்டுவிட்டு வெளியே வந்து விடுவான். இந்த வைத்தியன் கைவிட்டால் பிறகு மரணம் தான் என்று ஊரே புகழ்ந்தது.

கொஞ்ச நாளில் அந்த ஊர் அரசரின் மகள் நோய் வாய்ப்பட்டாள். யார் வைத்தியம் பார்த்தும் பலனில்லை. இவனை அழைத்தார்கள். 

"என் மகளைக் காப்பாற்றினால் அவளையே உனக்கு மனைவியாகத் தருகிறேன், கூடவே என் ராஜ்ஜியத்தையும் தருகிறேன்" என்றார் ராஜா. 

அவள் நோய் வாய்ப்பட்டு படுத்திருக்கும்அறைக்குள் போன வைத்தியனுக்கு அதிர்ச்சி. எமன் (அப்பா) நின்று கொண்டிருந்தார். வைத்தியம் செய்தால் பிழைக்க மாட்டாள். ஆனால் பிழைத்துவிட்டால் அழகான அந்த ராஜகுமாரி, ராஜ்ஜியம் எல்லாம் கிடைக்கும். இடைஞ்சலாக அப்பா குறுக்கே நிற்கிறார். எப்படி அவரை விரட்டுவது? பளிச்சென்று யோசனை பிறந்தது. 

வாசல் பக்கம் பார்த்து கத்தினான். "அம்மா.. அப்பா உள்ளே தான் இருக்கார். ரொம்ப நாளா அப்பாவைக் காணோம் காணோம்னு தேடினேயே.. இங்க. வந்துப் பாரும்மா.. இங்கதான் இருக்கார்!" என்று அலறினான். 

அவ்வளவுதான்.. "துண்டைக் காணோம் துணியைக் காணோம்" என்று எமன் ஒரே ஓட்டம் தான். 

கதை எப்படி??

"மனைவி அமைவதெல்லாம், 
இறைவன் கொடுத்த வரம்" 

சரிதானே??

04/10/15, 6:33 PM - Harish Kumaraswami: 😂😂😂👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
05/10/15, 8:22 AM - Pornima Akka: Two small stories (it's important you read both) that show how the examples we set today, may help shape the character of generations tomorrow.
---------------------------------
STORY - I
We all know about Al Capone. The notorious gangster, mafia who virtually owned Chicago. He was a crime boss who lorded over the windy city dealing with all sort of crimes prostitution to murder to ...you name it...and he escaped the law for many many years. It was because of one man his -lawyer nicknamed "Easy Eddie."
Eddie was very good! In fact, Eddie's skill at legal maneuvering kept Big Al out of jail for a long time.
To show his appreciation, Capone paid him very well. Not only was the money big, but Eddie got special dividends, as well.
For instance, he and his family occupied a fenced-in mansion with live-in help and all of the conveniences of the day.. The estate was so large that it filled an entire Chicago City block.
Eddie did have one soft spot, however. He had a son that he loved dearly.
And, despite his involvement with organized crime, Eddie tried to teach him right from wrong. Eddie wanted his son to be a better man than he was. Yet, with all his wealth and influence, there were two things he couldn't give his son- he couldn't pass on a Good Name or a Good Example.
One day, Easy Eddie reached a difficult decision. It's believed Easy Eddie wanted to rectify wrongs he had done.
So he decided he would go to the authorities and tell the truth about Al "Scarface" Capone, clean up his tarnished name, and offer his son some semblance of integrity. To do this, he would have to testify against The Mob, and he knew that the cost would be great. 
Nevertheless, he testified.
Within the year, Easy Eddie's life ended in a blaze of gunfire on a lonely Chicago Street. But in his eyes, he had given his son the greatest gift he had to offer, at the greatest price he could ever pay. Police removed from his pockets a rosary, a religious symbol and medallion, and a poem clipped from a magazine.
The Poem read:
"The clock of life is wound but once, and no man has the power to tell just when the hands will stop, at late or early hour. Now is the only time you own. Live, love, toil with a will. Place no faith in time. For the clock may soon be still."
---------------------------------
STORY - II
World War II produced many heroes. One such man was Lieutenant Cdr Butch O'Hare. He was a fighter pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier Lexington in the South Pacific.
One day his entire squadron was sent on a mission. After he was airborne, he looked at his fuel gauge and realized that someone had forgotten to top off his fuel tank.
He would not have enough fuel to complete his mission and get back to his ship.
His flight leader told him to return to the carrier. Reluctantly, he dropped out of formation and headed back to the fleet.
As he was returning to the mother ship, he saw something that turned his blood cold; a squadron of Japanese aircraft was speeding its way toward the American fleet.
The American fighters were gone on a sortie, and the fleet was all but defenseless. He couldn't reach his squadron and bring them back in time to save the fleet. Nor could he warn the fleet of the approaching danger. There was only one thing to do, only thing he'd learned growing up. He must somehow divert them from the fleet.
Laying aside all thoughts of personal safety, he dove into the formation of Japanese planes. Wing-mounted 50 caliber's blazed as he charged in, attacking one surprised enemy plane and then another. Butch wove in and out of the now broken formation and fired at as many planes as possible until all his ammunition was finally spent.
Undaunted, he continued the assault. He dove at the planes, trying to clip a wing or tail in hopes of damaging as many enemy planes as possible, rendering them unfit to fly.
Finally, the exasperated Japanese squadron took off in another direction.
Deeply relieved, Butch O'Hare and his tattered fighter limped back to the carrier.
Upon arrival, he reported in and related the event surrounding his return. The film from the gun-camera mounted on his plane told the tale. It showed the extent of Butch's daring attempt to protect his fleet. He had, in fact, destroyed five enemy aircraft.
This took place on February 20, 1942 , and for that action Butch became the Navy's first Ace of W.W.II, and the first Naval Aviator to win the Medal of Honor.
A year later Butch was killed in aerial combat at the age of 29. His home town would not allow the memory of this WW II hero to fade, and today, O'Hare Airport in Chicago is named in tribute to the courage of this great man.
So, the next time you find yourself at O'Hare International, give some thought to visiting Butch's memorial displaying his statue and his Medal of Honor. It's located between Terminals 1 and 2.
---------------------------------
Uh..wait, what do these two stories have to do with each other? 
Well, you see, Butch O'Hare was .............
"Easy Eddie's" son.

07/10/15, 9:16 PM - Vidya Perima: Very interesting & meaningful msg to share:

If:
A B C D E F G H I J K LM N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
is equal to:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

Then,

H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K ;
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11=98%

K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E ;
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5=96%

L+O+V+E;
12+15+22+5 = 54%

L+U+C+K ;
12+21+3+11 = 47%

None of them makes 100%. Then what makes 100%?

Is it Money? NO!

M+O+N+E+Y= 13+15+14+5+25=72%

Leadership? NO!

L+E+A+D+E+R+S+H+I+P= 12+5+1+4+5+18+19+8+9+16=97%

Every problem has a solution, only if we perhaps change our "ATTITUDE"...

A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E ;
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%

It is therefore OUR ATTITUDE towards Life and Work that makes 
OUR Life 100% Successful.

Amazing mathematics

🔥A woman's experience with burns ...🔥
    
Some time ago I was cooking some corn and stuck my fork in the boiling water to see if the corn was ready. I missed and my hand went into the boiling water....!!

A friend of mine, who was a Vietnam vet, came into the house, as I was screaming, & asked me if I had some plain old wheat flour... 

I pulled out a bag and he stuck my hand in it. He told me to keep my hand in the flour for 10 minutes. 

He said, In Vietnam , there was a guy on fire and in their panic, they threw a bag of flour all over him to put the fire out...Well, it not only put the fire out, but he never even had a blister!!!!

... Long story short, I put my hand in the bag of flour for 10 mins, pulled it out and did not even have a red mark or a blister & absolutely NO PAIN. 

Now, I keep a bag of flour in the fridge and every time I burn myself. *Cold flour feels even better than room temperature flour.

I use the wheat flour and have never ever had even a red spot/burn mark, or a blister! 

I even burnt my tongue once, put the flour on it for about 10 minutes .... the pain was gone and no burn.

Try it . . . Experience a miracle!  

Keep a bag of flour in your fridge and you will be happy you did!
👌😊😊😊👍☺☺☺✌

Flour has heat absorbant property and also is stong antioxident property. Thus helps in burns patient if apllied within 15 minutes.

Worth Reading....                             By P Narayana Murthy

My wife called, 'How long will you be with that newspaper? Will you  come here and make your darling daughter eat her food?

I tossed the paper away and rushed to the scene. My only daughter, Sindu, looked frightened; tears were welling up in her eyes. 

In front of her was a bowl filled to its brim with curd rice. Sindu is a nice child, quite and  intelligent for her age.

I picked up the bowl. 'Sindu, darling, why don't you take a few mouthful of this curd rice? Just for Dad's sake, dear'.

Sindu softened a bit and wiped her tears with the back of her hands. 'Ok, Dad. I will eat - not just a few mouthfuls, but the whole lot of this. But, you should...' Sindu hesitated...... 'Dad, if I eat this entire curd Rice, will you give me whatever I ask for?'

'Promise'. I covered the pink soft hand extended by my daughter with mine, and clinched the deal.

Now I became a bit anxious. 'Sindu, dear, you shouldn't insist on getting a computer or any such expensive items. Dad does not have that kind of money right now. Ok?'

'No, Dad. I do not want anything expensive.'

Slowly and painfully, she finished eating the whole quantity. I was silently angry with my wife and my mother for forcing my child to eat something that she detested.

After the ordeal was through, Sindu came to me with her eyes wide with expectation. All our attention was on her.

'Dad, I want to have my head shaved off, this Sunday!' was her demand.

'Atrocious!' shouted my wife, 'A girl child having her head shaved off? Impossible!'

'Never in our family!' My mother rasped. 'She has been watching too much of television. Our culture is getting totally spoiled with these TV programs!'

'Sindu, darling, why don't you ask for something else? We will be sad seeing you with a clean-shaven head.'

'Please, Sindu, why don't you try to understand our feelings?' I tried to plead with her.

'Dad, you saw how difficult it was for me to eat that Curd Rice'. Sindu was in tears. 'And you promised to grant me whatever I ask for. Now, you are going back on your words. 
"Was it not you who told me the story of King Harishchandra, and its moral that we should honor our promises no matter what?'

It was time for me to call the shots. 'Our promise must be kept.'

'Are you out of your mind?' chorused my mother and wife.

'No. If we go back on our promises, she will never learn to honour her own. Sindu, your wish will be fulfilled.'

With her head clean-shaven, Sindu had a round-face, and her eyes looked big and beautiful.

On Monday morning, I dropped her at her school. It was a sight to watch my hairless Sindu walking towards her classroom. She turned around and waved. I waved back with a smile. 

Just then, a boy alighted from a car, and shouted, 'Sinduja, please wait for me!' What struck me was the hairless head of that boy. 'May be, that is the in-stuff', I thought.

A lady got out of car and came to me. She said 'Sir, your daughter Sinduja is great indeed! That boy who is walking along with your daughter is my son, Harish. He is suffering from... leukemia'. She paused to muffle her sobs. 

'Harish could not attend the school for the whole of the last month. He lost all his hair due to the side effects of the chemotherapy. He refused to come back to school fearing the unintentional but cruel teasing of the schoolmates.
...... Sinduja visited him last week, and promised him that she will take care of the teasing issue.....

"But, I never imagined she would sacrifice her lovely hair for the sake of my son! Sir, you and your wife are blessed to have such a noble soul as your daughter.'

I stood transfixed with tears 'My little Angel, you are teaching me how selfless real love is!'

The happiest people on this planet are not those who live on their own terms but are those who change their terms for others!

# A woman writes to the IT Technical.support Guy

Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and I noticed a distinct slowdown in the overall system performance,.particularly in the flower and jewellery applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0
In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled another
valuable program, Romance 9.5
And then installed undesirable programs such as NEWS 5.0, MONEY 3.0 and CRICKET 4.1
What can I do ?

# Reply:
Dear Madam,
First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment  Package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.
Please enter command: ithoughtyoulovedme.html and try to download Tears 6.2
Then it will automatically run the
applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5
However, remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Silence 2.5 , Beer 6.1 or Whisky 6.8
Also DO NOT disturb the original package of Husband 1.0
Otherwise new virus Girlfriend 2.5 will automatically be downloaded into your system. So please be careful.
In addition, please do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0
We recommend: Cooking 3.0 and Hot Looks 7.7
Good Luck Madam !

13/10/15, 10:24 PM - Pornima Akka: It was a crowded flight and a beautiful lady aged around 40 years boarded the flight as the passenger. She searched for her seat and found her seat was next to a black man.

She showed that she wasn’t in a hurry to take her seat as she found it too hard and awkward to sit next to a black man.

Feeling disgusted, the beautiful lady called the air hostess and asked her to change her seat.

The air hostess requested for a reason why she would like to change the seat.
She replied, “It is impossible for me to sit next to a black man, I hate it! 

The air hostess was shocked to hear these hard words from the one who looked so dignified and composed.
She again demanded her to get her a new seat. The airhostess said she would do so and requested her to wait for a few minutes. 

The air hostess went in search of an empty seat for the lady. The air hostess told the lady, ‘I’m afraid Madam, there is no vacant seat in the economy class and the flight is almost full! However, we do follow the policy to fulfil the desires of our passengers to the maximum extent possible. So, give me a minute, I will check with my captain and get back to you, as we feel it is not fair to force a passenger to have an unpleasant seat!’

The lady waited for a couple of minutes and the air hostess came.

The latter replied, ‘Madam, sorry for this inconvenience. We don’t want to make your journey unpleasant by making you sit next to someone with whom you aren’t comfortable. There is one seat available in the First Class. Although we don’t allow any passenger to move from economy class to first class, to make you a happy customer, we are doing this for the first time in our company’s history. Our captain agreed to shift from economy class to first class.!’

Just before the lady said any word as a reply, the air hostess humbly requested the black man and told him, ‘Dear sir, would you please shift your seat to first class? Please retrieve all your personal items from your seat and our captain would like to move you to first class as we don’t really want you to have an uncomfortable journey sitting next an unpleasant person, with an ugly mind!‘

The lady was quiet and frozen! A few of the fellow passengers were happy and gave huge applause for the flight crew!

Kindly read this awesome story - its little lengthy but truly touching.
Also like to request you  to Fwd to all right-thinking people who detest discrimination based on colour, race, caste and religion.

17/10/15, 11:31 AM - natarajan ramu: "எட்டு" போடுகிறவனுக்கு "நோய்"
எட்டிப் போகும் என்பது ஒரு பழமொழி.

மனித மன, உடல் பிரச்சினைக்கு காரணம்
அவன் கர்மா, அந்த கர்மா வழி உடலுக்கு
வருகிறது "நோய்". 

நோய் வருத்தும் பொழுது, வருந்தும் உடல்,
அதிலிருந்து விடுபட்டு நிரந்தர நிம்மதியை தேடிக் கொள்ளவே விரும்பும்.

சித்தர் வழி என்பது அனைத்துக்கும்
தெளிவான விடைகளை தருகிறது.

சித்தர்கள் :

"எட்டுப் போடு! எல்லாம் பறந்தோடும்!"

என்கிறார்கள்.

நம்மில் பலரும், நீரிழவு நோய், உயர்
அல்லது தாழ்ந்த ரத்த அழுத்தம்,
மார்புச்சளி போன்றவைகளால் மிக
பாதிப்படைந்திருப்போம். 

எத்தனைதான்
மருந்து சாப்பிட்டாலும் (சாப்பாட்டில்
கட்டுப்பாடு இல்லாமல் போவதால்)
மறுபடியும் இவை தாக்கும்.

இந்த நோய்களை, கொல்லாமல் கொல்லும்
நோய்கள் தரவரிசையில் வைத்துள்ளனர்
சித்தர்கள். 

இதிலிருந்து விடுபட்டு, நாம்
மனிதர்கள், நலமாக வாழ வேண்டும்
என்பதற்காக இந்த முறையை வகுத்துக்
கொடுத்துள்ளனர். 

காலை நேரத்திலோ, அல்லது நேரம்
கிடைக்கும் பொழுதோ, ஒரு
அறையிலோ அல்லது
வெட்டவேளியிலோ (குறைந்தது 15 அடி
நீளம் வேண்டும்) எட்டு போடுகிற
வடிவத்தில் குறைந்தது 30 நிமிடங்கள்
நடை பயிற்சி செய்ய வேண்டும். 

முதல் 15 நிமிடங்கள் தெற்கிலிருந்து வடக்காக
நடந்தால், அடுத்த 15 நிமிடங்கள்
வடக்கிலிருந்து தெற்காக நடக்க
வேண்டும். இதை ஒரு நாளைக்கு
இருமுறை செய்ய வேண்டும்.

காலையும், மாலையும் வேளைகள்
மிக வசதியாக இருக்கும்.

இதை செய்வதால் என்ன நடக்கும்!

1. பயிற்சி தொடங்கிய அன்றே மார்பு சளி
கரைந்து வெளியேறுவதை காணலாம்.

2. இந்த பயிற்சியை இருவேளை
செய்துவந்தால், உள்ளங்கை கை விரல்கள்
சிவந்திருப்பதை காணலாம். அதாவது
ரத்த ஓட்டத்தை சமன்படுத்துகிறது என்று
அர்த்தம்.

3. நிச்சயம் நீரிழவு நோய் (சர்க்கரை
வியாதி) குறைந்து முற்றிலும்
குணமாகும். (பின்னர் மாத்திரை,
மருந்துகள் தேவை இல்லை).

4. குளிர்ச்சியினால் ஏற்படும் தலைவலி,
மலச்சிக்கல் போன்றவை தீரும்.

5. கண் பார்வை அதிகரிக்கும். ஆரம்ப நிலை
கண்ணாடி அணிவதை தவிர்க்கலாம்.

6. கேட்கும் திறன் அதிகரிக்கும்.

7. உடல் சக்தி பெருகும்- ஆதார சக்கரங்கள்
சரியாக செயல்படும்.

8. குடல் இறக்க நோய் வருவதை தடுக்கும்.

9. ரத்த அழுத்தம் நிச்சயமாக கட்டுப்பாட்டில்
வரும்.

10. பாத வலி, மூட்டுவலி மறையும்.

11. சுவாசம் சீராகும் அதனால் உள்
உருப்புக்கள் பலம் பெரும்.

சரி! இதெப்படி நடக்கிறது என்று
உங்களுக்குள் கேள்வி ஏழும். 

"8" வடிவில் நடை பயிற்சி செய்யும் பொழுது
நீங்களே உணர்வீர்கள், 

அந்த வடிவம்
"முடிவில்லாதது" மட்டுமல்ல, நமது
ஆதார சக்கரங்களை தட்டி எழுப்பி, சம
நிலை படுத்துகிறது. 

இதை நமக்கு உடல் பயிற்சியாக சொல்லித்தந்த
சித்தர்கள், இதையே "வாசி
யோகத்தில்" (மூச்சு பயிற்சியில்)
உள்ளுக்குள்ளே சுவாசத்தை விரட்டி
எட்டு போடுவார்கள் என்பது தெரியுமோ?

விருப்பம் உள்ளவர்கள், முயற்சி செய்து
பலனடையுங்கள்!

ஆனந்தம் ஆரோக்கியம்!!!

26/10/15, 9:31 PM - Pornima Akka: A pregnant mother asked her daughter, “What do u want- A brother or a sister?“

Daughter:- Brother

Mother:- Like whom?

Daughter:- Like RAVAN

Mother:- What the hell are you saying? Are you out of your mind?

Daughter:- Why not Mom? He left all his Royalship &
Kingdom, all because his sister was disrespected.
Even after picking up his enemy’s wife, he didn’t ever touch her. Why wouldn’t I want to have a brother like him?
What would I do with a brother like Ram who left his pregnant wife after listening to a “Dhobi” though his wife always stood by his side like a shadow? After giving “Agni Pareeksha” & suffering 14 years of exile.
Mom, you being a wife & sister to someone, until when will you keep on asking for a “RAM” as your son???

Mother was in tears.

Moral:- No one in the world is good or bad. Its just an interpretation about someone. Change Ur perception

Read it u will surely ENJOY This..... 

One Night 4 college students were playing till late night and could not study for the test which was scheduled for the next day. 
  
In the morning they thought of a plan. They made themselves look as dirty with grease and dirt. They then went up to the Dean and said that they had gone out to a wedding last night and on their return the tyre of their car burst and they had to push the car all the way back and that they were in no condition to appear for the test. 
  
So the Dean said they could have the re-test after 3 days. They thanked him and said they would be ready by that time. 
  
On the third day they appeared before the Dean. The Dean said that as this was a Special Condition Test, all four were required to sit in separate classrooms for the test. They all agreed as they had prepared well in the last 3 days. 

The Test consisted of 2 questions with a total of 100 Marks. 
  
See Below for the question Paper 
  
Q.1. Your Name........ .........
(2 MARKS) 

 Q.2.. Which tyre burst?
(98 MARKS) 
  
       a) Front Left           
       b) Front Right 
       c) Back Left            
       d) Back Right

30/10/15, 7:36 AM - natarajan ramu: Dear All,
Wanted to highlight one very important aspect. In ordinary course we keep issuing and submitting our KYC documents (identity and residential proofs..such as PAN card, electricity bill etc.) to various people. For housing or car or other loans, bank accounts,or even for buying new sim card we submit these documents.
At almost all these places they ask for self certification on these documents. We immediately sign those documents and hand over. Just imagine your self certified copies are freely available in the hands of such persons & those documents can be used by him for EVERYTHING!
Its really serious and its been seen that in most of the terrorist activities, KYC documents are sourced from the SIM card sellers.
Hence, please inculcate a 'HABIT' of writing the date and purpose for which you are submitting the self certified KYC Documents so that those documents cannot be used again.
Please share this as much as possible

09/11/15, 6:26 PM - Paiya perrippa: A 24-year old boy looking out through a train's
window shouted, Dad, look, "the trees are going
behind; they are moving very fast" his Dad simply
stared at him with so much joy and smiled! A
young couple seated nearby looked at the 24-year
old and thought to themselves, he's so grown up
but so childish, he must have a mental disorder
for his father not to be bothered. Suddenly the
young man exclaimed again; Dad, look, "the
clouds are running with us" the couple could not
resist and said to the old man, why don't you
take your son to a good doctor may be a
psychiatrist? The old man smiled and said I just
did. We are just coming from a doctor but not a
psychiatrist ; we are just coming from the
hospital. My son was blind from birth. He just got
his sight today for the very first time, his behavior
may seem stupid to you, it's more than a miracle
to me. The young couple just sat down there, lost
for words with a mixture of tears and shame in
their eyes..
Everybody on earth has a story; don't judge
people so fast or jump into conclusion about their
private affairs; you don't know where they are
coming from or what they have to deal with.
The truth behind their story might surprise you.
Take it easy with others, even if you have a
perfect life. Let us keep working towards the good
of all.
This story inspired me and I have shared it with
you to inspire you too. I hope you will share it to
inspire others.

11/11/15, 10:46 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: This day that time...
Once paiya perrippa told me something that happened this day 38 years ago. I thought I would share it with all of you. (Hope some of you remember this).
Sulo family (sulo,ramu,bhanu athai, nagu perippa, appa and paiya perippa) were living in srirangam. Nagu perippa was studying in national college and appa in srirangam high school. That year monsoon rain was severe. That day (12-11-1977) around 3pm paiya perippa’s friend, sridhara gopalan informed him about the threat of a flood situation for the low lying areas of srirangam, because of cauvery and colleroon dams, reached its capacity. Paiya perippa and his friend went to coleroon which was near by their house to see the flood. Paiya perippa was stunned by the heavy flood. All srirangam residents were panicked as they were excepting flood water inside the city. Srirangam was cut off from any outside contact. Cauvery and coolron joined forces (flooded). 
PWD had alerted all resident to stay in high raised building. As expected water entered the city and water level started raising gradually. All of them with their minimum belongings reached their neighbor’s house, which was slightly elevated to get seated in their terrace. There was no power, no food, not even a drop of drinking water (Water- water everywhere, but not a drop to drink). Scattered rain. They spent the entire night admiring the stars, with a sight precaution, as the water level was constantly raising and the ground floor was nearly filled with it. (I hope)They were just praying for life as there was no other option. 
Next day dawn…
Flood water remains in the same height. Paiya perrippa came down started walking / swimming and reached the corner of the street. Literally every place was filled with water. Normal life was disturbed. The kind Iyengar from the corner house gave them coffee. Food was distributed from a common place. MGR (Then C.M) was flying in helicopter in and around the flooded parts(included that terrace also). Around noon, water started receding. They went back to their house. It was full of water and when it was their turn to clean the mess, it became a nuisance. It would have been a nightmare. 
Next day, before this fiasco receded, they received another message that mettur dam has given way and there will be one more flood whose magnitude will be much more than the previous one and that the entire srirangam would be washed away. People were running post to pillar for survival. Very few buses were taking risk and plying from srirngam to town and were with fully crowded. Then, paiya perippa thought for a while and decided to send bhanu athai, nagu perippa and appa to vijiya athai’s house at OFT for their safety. Paiya perippa thought, If he was washed away in flood , BHEL will pay him dependent DRF (death relief fund) Rs.10,000 and few final settlement like PF, Gratuity etc to Rs.5000(which was a huge amount then). His monthly salary then was Rs.600 and he said that was sufficient for running the whole family then. With his final settlement nagu perippa and appa could complete college education and a good amount for banu athai’s marriage would have been arranged. With this in mind he sent them to vijiya athai’s house. He was hoping to see them soon only if faith permitted it. Paiya perippa, sulo and ramu were in their house expecting flood any time .Fortunately even after few hours of expectation the event did not turn up. Then, by the evening, Trichy’s collector made an announcement that the flood threat was a hoax and all dams were intact. Thus they all survived.
11/11/15, 10:47 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: The above message is not a forward message just because its long, so please read it....

20/11/15, 9:20 PM - Vidya Perima: ஒரு லேடீஸ் கிளப் கூட்டதில் வந்திருந்த நடுவர் அங்கிருந்த பெண்களை நோக்கி, " நீங்கள் உங்கள் கணவரிடம் எப்பொழுது  கடைசியாக "I LOVE YOU" என்று சொன்னீர்கள்  என்று  கேட்டார்.

ஒரு பெண்... இன்று என்று கூறினாள் 

அடுத்த பெண் .. இரண்டு நாட்கள் முன் என்று கூறினாள் 

ஒரு சிலர் .. ஒரு வாரம் முன்பு என்று கூறினார்கள்.

நடுவர் : " நீங்கள் அனைவரும் அவரவர் கணவருக்கு "I LOVE YOU" என்று மெசேஜ்  அனுப்புங்கள் இப்பொழுது, யாருக்கு வியப்பான பதில் வருகிறதோ அவர்களுக்கு ஒரு சிறந்த பரிசு காத்திருகிறது" என்றார். 
   
ஒவ்வொருவரும் அவரவர் கணவருக்கு மெசேஜ் அனுப்பத் தொடங்கினார்கள்.

மெசேஜ்க்கு வந்த பதில்கள் 
 
நபர் 1 : அன்பே.... உனக்கு உடம்புக்கு ஒன்னும் பிரச்சனை இல்லையே ??

நபர் 2 : இன்னைக்கு நீ சாப்பாடு செய்யலியா??

நபர் 3 : நான் குடும்ப செலவுக்கு குடுத்த பணம் தீர்ந்து விட்டதா??

நபர் 4 : என்ன பிரச்சனை உனக்கு??

நபர் 5 : நீ கனவு கண்டுட்டு இருக்கியா இல்லை நான் கனவு காண்கிறேனா??

நபர் 6 : இன்னைக்கு போன கல்யாணத்துல உன் பிரண்டு போட்ட நகை டிசைன் எதாவது உனக்கு ரொம்ப பிடிச்சு, வாங்க பிளான் போட்டுருக்கியா ??

நபர் 10 : குழந்தைகளை பள்ளிக் கூடத்திலிருந்து கூட்டிட்டு வரணுமா???

கடைசியாக பரிசு பெற்ற  பெண்ணுக்கு வந்த பதில் மெசேஜ்..
நபர் 11 : யார் இது... என் பொண்டாட்டி மொபைல்ல இருந்து எனக்கு மெசேஜ் அனுப்பறது?? 😛😜

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

முதலமைச்சர் காமராஜரும்.. பிரதமர் நேருவும்.. கூட்டமொன்றில் பங்கேற்க.. மதுரை அருகே.. காரில் சென்று கொண்டிருந்தார்கள்..!!

உரையாடலின் நடுவே.. நினைவு வந்தவரான. நேரு. " மிஸ்டர் காமராஜ் உங்கள் சொந்த ஊர் இந்த பக்கம் தானே..? என்று கேட்கிறார்..!!

"ஆமாங்க இன்னும் கொஞ்சம் தூரத்தில் தான் இருக்கிறது..!!என்கிறார் காமராஜர்..!!

"அப்படியானால் உங்கள் தாயாரை பார்த்து விட்டு.. நலம் விசாரித்து விட்டு செல்ல வேண்டும் அல்லவா..? என்று நேரு அவர்கள் கேட்க..
"இப்பவே கூட்டத்திற்கு நேரம் ஆகி விட்டதே..?" என்று காமராஜர் மறுக்கிறார்..!!

அதற்கு நேரு அவர்கள்...
"இவ்வளவு தூரம் வந்து விட்டு.. உங்கள் தாயாரை பார்க்காமல் சென்றால்.. நன்றாக இருக்காது.. நான் பார்த்தே ஆக வேண்டும்.. என்னை அவர்களிடம் கூட்டிச் செல்லுங்கள்..!!" என்று அன்பு கட்டளையிடுகிறார்
ஆமோதித்த காமராஜர்..

வண்டி சற்று தூரம் சென்றதும்.. ஓட்டுனரிடம்.." தம்பி வண்டியை இப்படி ஓரங்கட்டு..!!" என்று வண்டியை நிறுத்த சொல்கிறார்..!!
அது வீடுகளே இல்லாத பகுதி.. இரு புறங்களிலும் விவசாய நிலங்கள் பகுதி..!!

அந்த நிலங்களில் பெண்கள் களை பறித்து கொண்டிருந்தனர்..!!
தாயாரை பார்க்க வீட்டுக்கு அழைத்து.. செல்ல சொன்னால் இப்படி அத்துவான வெயிலில்.. வண்டியை நிறுத்தியிருக்கிறாரே..! என்ற வினாவுடன் வண்டியை விட்டு இறங்குகிறார் நேரு..

காமராஜர்
களை பறித்து கொண்டிருக்கும் பெண்கள்.. கூட்டத்திலிருந்து வயதான பெண்மணி.. ஒருவரை அழைக்கிறார்...

"ஆத்தா நான் காமராசு வந்து இருக்கிறேன்.."!! என்று கூவுகிறார்..!!

வயலில் உழைத்து வியர்வை முகத்துடன்.. "காமராசு வந்திட்டியாப்பா.. நல்லாயிருக்கியா..?" என்று தன் மகனை கண்ட மகிழ்ச்சியில்.. உள்ளம் நெகிழ.. அருகில் வருகிறார்.. காமராஜரின் தாயார்..!!

தாயும் மகனும் அளவளாவிக் கொள்கிறார்கள்..!!

பிறகு நேரு அவர்களை காட்டி.. அறிமுக படுத்துகிறார் காமராஜர்..!!

நேருவால்
தன் முன்னால் நடப்பதை பார்த்து.. நம்ப முடியாமல் சிலையாக நிற்கிறார்..!!
அவர் தான் நம் காமராஜர்..!

இன்றைய அரசியல்வாதிகளின் நிலை இப்படியா?????????

22/11/15, 7:24 AM - Vidya Perima: I am personally ashamed that I was not aware of the existence of this noble and great man, Kalyanasundaram honoured by US Govt. I feel equally ashamed that India Govt has conferred 'Bharat Ratna' on Sachin Tendulkar, who seeks and gets exemption of customs duty on a 'Ferrari' which he got free, who reportedly earns crores of rupees(in hundreds) every year.
Mr.Kalayanasundaram worked as a Librarian for 30 years. Every month in his 30 year experience (service), he donated his entire salary to help the needy. He worked as a server in a hotel to meet his needs. He donated even his pension amount of about ten lakh rupees to the needy.
He is the first person in the world to spend the entire earnings for a social cause. In recognition to his service, the American government honoured him with the ‘Man of the Millennium’ award. He received a sum of Rs 30 crores as part of this award which he distributed entirely for the needy as usual.
Moved by his passion to help others, Super Star Rajinikanth adopted him as his father. He still stays as a bachelor and dedicated his entire life for serving the society.
All our Politicians, Film stars, Business magnets, cricketers Press and we all Indians should be PROUD and also should be ashamed of ourselves. American Government has honored him but we Indians even don't know that such a personality exist amongst us.
Atleast have the courtesy to pass this on and on till the whole world comes to know about this Great Good Samaritan.
Hat's off Kalayanasundaram.. We Indians are extremely proud of you and proudly say "THIS HAPPENS ONLY IN INDIA".

22/11/15, 9:36 PM - Vidya Perima: DURYODHAN & RAHUL GANDHI - BOTH WITHOUT TALENT. BUT YET WANTED TO BE RULERS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF BIRTH-RIGHT.

BHISHMA & ADVANI NEVER CROWNED. GOT RESPECT & YET BECAME HELPLESS AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES.

ARJUN & NARENDRA BOTH TALENTED. REACHED THE HIGHEST POSITION DUE TO BEING ON THE SIDE OF DHARMA. BUT REALISE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FOLLOW AND PRACTICE.

KARNA & MANMOHAN SINGH BOTH INTELLIGENT. BUT NEVER REACHED ANYWHERE BEING ON THE SIDE OF ADHARMA.

ABHIMANYU & KEJRIWAL BOTH NEW IN WAR. THEY DID NOT PASS THE CHAKRAVYUH TEST THAT ENEMIES HAD SPREAD AROUND THEM & GOT TRAPPED SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.

SHAKUNI & DIGVIJAY SINGH BOTH WANTED THEIR MASTERS TO BE HAPPY IRRESPECTIVE OF TALENT OR RIGHT.

DHRITRASHTRA & SONIA BOTH WERE BLIND FOR LOVE OF THEIR SONS.

AND LAST - KRISHNA AND ABDUL KALAM. WE CELEBRATE BOTH OF THEM BUT DO NOT FOLLOW WHAT THEY TAUGHT AND PREACHED. 

THIS IS BHARAT AND MAHABHARAT

06/12/15, 10:03 PM - natarajan ramu: டிசம்பர் 16 ல் பூமி என்னாகும்? விஞ்ஞானி விளக்கம்

உண்மை காலில் செருப்பு போடுவதற்குள் பொய் ஒருமுறை உலகை சுற்றி வந்துவிடும் என்பார்கள் வதந்திகளைப்பற்றி. இப்படி மனதில் பீதியை கிளப்பும் இரண்டு செய்திகள் வாட்ஸ்-அப் மற்றும் சமூக வலைத்தளங்களில் தற்போதுb அதிவேகமாக பரவிக்கொண்டிருகிறது.  

“சென்னையில் பெய்து வருவது வெறும் மழை அல்ல. NASA ரிப்போர்ட் படி இதோட பெயர் 'EL Nino' சுழற்சி புயல். கிட்டதட்ட 250 Cm வரைக்கும் இந்த மழை பெய்ய வாய்ப்பு உண்டு. சென்னையே மூழ்கிப்போக வாய்ப்பு உண்டு. google ல Search பண்ணி பாருங்க தெரியும். எப்படியாவது நம் சென்னை மக்களுக்கு தெரியப்படுத்துங்க...
PLZ... அரசாங்கம் இத பொருட்டா எடுத்துக்கல” - இது முதல் வதந்தி. 


டிசம்பர் 16 முதல் 22 வரை சூரிய புயலால் நாம் சூரியனை பார்ப்பது கடினம்... பூமி இருளில் முழ்கும் - நாசா அறிவிப்பு. - இது இரண்டாவது வதந்தி. 

இந்த 2 வதந்'தீ' கள் பற்றி தமிழ்நாடு அறிவியல் இயக்கம் விளக்கம் அளித்துள்ளது. இந்த இயக்கத்தை சேர்ந்த விஞ்ஞானி த.வி.வெங்கடேஸ்வரன் இதுபற்றிய உண்மை நிலையை தெளிவுபடுத்தியுள்ளார். 

”உண்மையில், 'எல் நினோ' என்பது தென் அமெரிக்கா பசுபிக் கடற்பகுதியில் ஏற்படும் வானிலை மாற்றம். பசுபிக் கடல் சற்றே சூடு அதிகமாகி அதன் காரணமாக தென் அமெரிக்கா, கலிபோர்னியா முதலிய இடங்களில் மழை பொழிவு ஏற்படும். 'எல் நினோ' உலக வானிலையில் தாக்கம் ஏற்படுத்தும் என்பதால் செயற்கை கோள்வழி அதனை கண்காணிக்க நாசா ஏற்பாடு செய்துள்ளது.

'எல் நினோ' தீவிரம் அடையும் ஆண்டுகளில் வங்காள விரிகுடாவின் கடல் நீர் வெப்பம் சற்றே உயரும். அதன் காரணமாக கூடுதல் நீராவி உயர்ந்து மழை கூடுதலாகும். 1997 ல் உருவான தீவிர 'எல் நினோ' போல இந்த ஆண்டும் தீவிரம் அடைந்து வருகிறது என நாசா வானிலை செயற்கைக் கோள்கள் கண்டுள்ளன.

￼

இந்த ஆண்டும் இதன் தொடர்ச்சியாக  1997 ல் நிகழ்ந்ததுபோல அமெரிக்கா பகுதிகளில் பெரு மழை பொழியும் என்றும், வரும் 2016- ம் ஆண்டு, சராசரிக்கும் கூடுதலான வெப்பம்  கொண்ட ஆண்டாக இருக்கும் எனவும் மதிப்பீடு செய்யப்பட்டுள்ளது. 'எல் நினோ' ஒரு புயல் அல்ல; சென்னையை நோக்கி வராது; சென்னை அல்லது தமிழகம் குறித்து நாசா எந்த ஒரு முன்னறிவிப்பையும் வெளியிடவில்லை. இதுவே நிஜம்.

இரண்டாவது வதந்தி, Huzlers.com எனும் வலைத்தளம் விஷமத்தனமாக வேடிக்கை காட்ட பரப்பிய செய்தி. இந்த போலியான செய்தி காட்டுத் தீ போல பரவி உலகெங்கும் பீதியை கிளப்பியிருக்கிறது. உண்மையில், சூரிய (காந்த) புயல் அவ்வப்போது ஏற்படும் என்பது உண்மைதான். இந்த காந்தப் புயல் பூமியை வந்து மோதும்போது விண்வெளியில் சுற்றும் செயற்கை கோள்களின் தகவல் தொடர்பு முதலியவை பாதிக்கப்படும். 

￼மிக தீவிர காந்த புயல் வீசினால் ஐரோப்பா முதலிய பகுதிகளில் குறிப்பாக துருவத்துக்கு அருகில் உள்ள பகுதிகளில் மின்தொகுப்பு கருவிகள் (ட்ரான்ஸ்பார்மர்கள்) செயலிழந்து ஐரோப்பிய நகரங்கள் இருளில் மூழ்கலாம் அவ்வளவுதான்.

மின்சாரம் தடைபடுவதால் மின்விளக்குகள் எரியாது. இதைத்தான் 'உலகமே இருன்று விடும்' என இணைய தளங்களில் பரப்பிவருகிறார்கள் விபரமறியாத விஷமிகள். நிஜத்தில் உலகே பல நாட்கள் இருண்டு விடாது. 

இதனால் உலகைப்பற்றியோ சென்னையைப்பற்றியோ யாரும் எந்த பதற்றத்திற்கும் உள்ளாகவேண்டாம். பரபரப்புக்கும் ஒருவித சுவாரஸ்யத்திற்கும் இப்படி செய்திகளை பரப்புபவர்கள் தாங்கள் மக்கள் மனதில் எத்தகைய பீதியை உண்டாக்குகிறோம் என்பதை உணர்வதில்லை” என்கிறார் த.வி.வெங்கடேஸ்வரன்.

யூத்ஸ்... கொஞ்சம் பொறுப்போட பதிவு செய்யுங்கப்பா பதிவுகளை!
06/12/15, 10:21 PM - natarajan ramu: உண்மையிலேயே புரிந்துதான் பேசுகிறார்களா இல்லை வெறுமனே அடுத்தவர்களை குறை கூறி புலம்புவதால் தங்கள் மனக்கவலை குறைவதாகத் தோன்றுவதால் இவ்வாறு செய்கிறார்களா என்று தெரியவில்லை ...

முதலாவதாக சென்னைக்கும் தமிழகத்திற்கும் இப்போது ஏற்பட்டிருப்பது சாதாரண அரசு எந்திரத்தால் கையாளப்படக் கூடிய வெள்ளப்பெருக்கு அல்ல...இது ஜப்பானில் உலகிலேயே மிகவும் பாதுகாப்பான ஃபுகுஷிமா அணுஉலையில் விபத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி பெரும்பாலான மக்கள் அணுக்கதிரியக்கத்தால் உயிரிழக்கக் காரணமான வெள்ளப் பேரழிவுக்கு அடுத்த பேரழிவாகும்...மறுபடியும் புரிந்து கொள்ளுங்கள் இது இயற்கை பேரழிவு சாதாரண வெள்ளப்பெருக்கு அல்ல...
மிகவும் வளர்ச்சி அடைந்த நிலையிலுள்ள ஜப்பானே அந்த அழிவிலிருந்து மீண்டுவரப் பட்டபாட்டை உலகம் அறியும்...அதனைப் போன்றதே இந்தப் பேரழிவும் என்பதை அறிந்ததாலேயே "சென்னை பேரழிவுக்கு உதவிபுரிய எல்லா வகையிலும் தயாராக இருப்பதாக இந்திய அரசாங்கத்திடம் அமெரிக்கா கூறியுள்ளது..."

இரண்டாவதாக மக்கள் அனைவரும் ஓட்டுப்போட்டு மனிதர்களைத்தான் தேர்ந்தெடுத்தோமே தவிர மந்திரவாதிகளை அல்ல என்பதை அனைவரும் கவனத்தில் கொள்ள வேண்டும்...
இயற்கை அடிக்கிறது, மனிதர்கள் பாதிக்கப்பட்டிருக்கிறார்கள், அவர்களை மீட்க வேண்டியவர்களும் அதே பாதிப்புகளை கடந்துதான் பாதிக்கப்பட்டவர்களை மீட்க வேண்டும்...தமிழக அமைச்சர்கள்,அனைத்து துறை தமிழக மீட்புக்குழு அதிகாரிகள், இந்திய இராணுவ, கப்பல்படை, விமானப்படை அதிகாரிகள், தேசிய பேரிடர் மீட்புக்குழு அதிகாரிகள் என அத்தனை பேரையும் சேர்த்து கணக்கிட்டாலும் பாதிக்கப்பட்டுள்ள லட்சக்கணக்கான சென்னை மக்களையும் நொடிப்பொழுதில் மீட்க வேண்டும் என்பது சினிமாவில் மட்டுமே சாத்தியம், நிஜத்தில் அது சாத்தியமே இல்லாதது என்பது அமைதியாக யோசித்தால் அனைவரும் புரிந்து கொள்ளக் கூடியதே...

மத்திய அரசு பிரித்துப் பிரித்துதான் நிவாரணத் தொகையை வழங்க வேண்டுமா? பிரதமர் மோடியும், முதலமைச்சர் ஜெயலலிதாவும் ஹெலிகாப்டர் மூலமாகத் தான் பாதிப்புகளை பார்வையிட வேண்டுமா? என்று மாற்றி மாற்றிக் குறை சொல்பவர்கள், தமிழகத்திற்கு மட்டுமல்ல இந்தியாவில் எங்கு இயற்கை பேரழிவு நிகழ்ந்தாலும் அந்த சூழ்நிலையில்  நம் அரசியலமைப்பு சட்டப்படி மத்திய அரசு சில வரைமுறைகள் படியே செயல்பட முடியும்... மேலும் இவ்வாறான பாதிப்புகள் முழுவதையும் குறைவான நேரத்தில் அனைத்துப் பகுதிகளிலும் அறிந்து அதற்கேற்ப அரசு எந்திரத்தை மீட்புப்பணிகளில் முடுக்க "ஏரியல் வியூ" ஒன்றே தீர்வு...அதுவே உலக வழக்கம்...அது ஹெலிகாப்டர் மூலம் மட்டுமே சாத்தியம்...அவர்கள் வெள்ளத்தில் இறங்கி நடந்தால் மட்டும்தான் மக்கள் பிரச்சினைகள் பற்றி தெரியும் என்று உலகமகா தத்துவத்தைச் சொல்லி சில அப்பாவி மக்களையும் அவ்வாறே நம்ப வைத்த ஸ்டாலின்,கருணாநிதி, ராமதாஸ், விஜயகாந்த், இளங்கோவன், வைகோ உள்ளிட்ட தலைவர்கள் இப்படிப்பட்ட பேரழிவிலும் அரசியல் செய்வது வருத்தத்திற்குரியது, வன்மையாகக் கண்டிக்கப்பட வேண்டியது என்பதை நாம் உணர வேண்டும்...

முதல்முறை ஏற்பட்ட வெள்ளப்பாதிப்பின்போது, அரசால் ஏற்படுத்தப்பட்ட நிவாரண முகாம்களுக்கு அதிகாரிகள் அழைத்தும் வெட்டி கவுரவத்தால் அங்கு போக மறுத்து வீட்டிலேயே இருந்த மக்கள் இரண்டாவது வெள்ளத்தில் அதிகமாகப் பாதிக்கப்பட்டார்கள் என்பது அதிர வைக்கும் உண்மை...

இந்தப் பேரழிவிலிருந்து மீண்டுவர அரசாங்கத்தை மட்டுமே எதிர்பார்த்துக் காத்துக்கொண்டிருந்து, அவர்கள் வருவதற்கு முன் வந்த தொலைக்காட்சி நிருபரிடம் கண்ணீர் விட்டு கதறுவதைவிட, மக்கள் தாங்களாகவே குழுவாகச் செயல்பட்டு வலியவர் எளியவர்க்கு உதவி செய்து ஒத்துழைத்து ஒன்றாகச் செயல்பட்டு மீண்டுவர வேண்டும்...புலம்புவது மற்றவர்களுக்கும் நம்பிக்கை குறைபாடை ஏற்படுத்துமே தவிர நிவாரணத்திற்கு எந்த வகையிலும் பயன்படாது...
இப்போது மீட்புப்பணியில் விரைவாக ஈடுபட முடியவில்லை என்று அரசைக் குற்றம் சுமத்தினால், வெள்ளம் வடிய வேண்டிய வழிகளிலெல்லாம் வீடுகளைக் கட்டி இந்த நிலை இவ்வளவு மோசமாகக் காரணமான மக்களும் குற்றவாளிகளே என்பதை உணர்ந்து பொறுப்புடன் "செயல்பட்டு" இதிலிருந்து மீள வேண்டும்...

தயவுசெய்து சென்னை மக்களுக்காக "உண்மையிலேயே" கவலைப்பட்டு, அவர்கள் மீண்டுவரப் பிரார்த்தனை செய்யும் அனைவருக்கும் இதைப் பகிருங்கள் 
🙏🙏🙏
06/12/15, 10:23 PM - natarajan ramu: உலகையே மிரள வைத்த திருநள்ளாறு கோவில்!
நாசாவுக்கே தண்ணிகாட்டிய திருநள்ளாறு!
இன்று பல நாடுகள் செயற்கைகோள்களை விண்வெளிக்கு அனுப்பி வருகின்றன. அவற்றில் செல்போன் பயன்பாடு, ராணுவ பயன்பாடு,உளவு என பல்வேறு கார ணங்களுக்காக பயன்படுத் தப்படுகிறது. சில வருடங் களுக்கு முன்பு அமெரிக்க செயற்கைகோள் ஒன்று பூமியின் குறிப்பிட்ட பகுதி யை கடக்கும் பொது மட்டு ம்
3 வினாடிகள் ஸ்தம்பி த்து விடுகிறது.
3 வினாடிக ளுக்கு பிறகு வழக்கம்போல் வானில் பறக்க ஆரம்பித்து விடுகிறது. எந்தவித பழு தும் அதன் செயற்கை கோளில், அதன் கருவிகளில் ஏற்படுவதில்லை.
இந்த சம்பவம் நாசாவிற்கு அதிர்ச்சி கலந்த ஆச்சரியதயை அளித்தது.
இது எப்படி சாத்தியம்??? – என்பதை ஆராய்ந்து, கிடைத்த முடிவு நாசாவை மட்டுமல்ல, உலகை யே மிரள வைத்தது.
ஆம்! எந்த ஒரு செயற்கைகோளும் பூமியில் இந்தியாவின்-தமிழ்நாடு அருகில் உள்ள
புதுச்சேரி- திருநள்ளாறு ஸ்ரீ தர்ப்பநேஷவரர் கோவிலுக்கு மேல் நேர் உள்ள வான்பகுதியை கடக்கும் 3 வினாடிகள் மட்டும் ஸ்தம்பித்து விடுகின்றன.
அப்படி நிகழ்வதற்கு என்ன காரணம் ???
ஒவ்வொரு நாளும் ஒவ்வொரு வினாடியும் கண்ணுக்கு தெரியாத கருநீலகதிர்கள் அந்த கோவிலின் மீது விழுந்துகொண்டே
இருக்கி றது.
இரண்டரை வருடங்களுக்கு ஒரு முறை நடக்கும் சனி பெயர்ச்சியின் பொது இந்த கரு நீல கதிர்களின் அடர்த்தி மிகவும் அதிகமாக இருக்கும். விண்வெளியில் சுற்றி கொண்டிருக்கும் செயற்கைகோள்கள் இந்த கரு நீலகதிர்கள் பாயும் பகுதிக்குள் நுழையும்போது ஸ்தம்பித்துவிடு
கின்றன. அதே நேரத்தில் செயற்கைகோள்களுக்கு எந்த வித பாதிப்பும் ஏற்படுவதில்லை.
இதில்குறிபிடத்தக்க அம்சம் என்னவென்றால் இந்த கோவில்தான் இந்துக்களால்
‘சனி பகவான்’ தலம் என்று போற்றபடுகிறது. இந்த சம்பவத்திற்கு பிறகு நாசாவிலிருந்து பல முறை திருநள்ளாறு வந்து ஆராய்ச்சி செய்து விட்டனர். மனிதனை மீறிய சக்தி உண்டு என்பதை உணர்ந்தனர். அவர்களும் சனிபகவானை கையெடுத்துகும்பிட்டு உணர்ந்தனர். இன்றுவரை விண்ணில் செயற்கை கோள்கள் திருநள்ளாறு பகுதியை கடக்கும் பொது ஸ்தம்பித்து கொண்டே இருக்கிறது.”
இந்த செய்தியை கேட்டு பிரமிக்காதவர்கள் நம்முடைய முன்னோர்களை நினைத்து கட்டயம் பிரமிக்கவேண்டும். நாம் பல செயற்கை கோள்கள் கொண்டு கண்டறியும் சனிகோளின் கதிர்வீச்சு விழும் பகுதியை கண்டு பிடித்து அதற்கென ஒரு கோயிலையும் கட்டி, கதிர் வீசுகள் அதில் விழும் நாட்களையும் கணக்கிட்டு அதற்க்கான நாளை சனிபெயர்ச்சி என்று அறி விக்கும் திறமையை, நம்மால் நினைத்துக்கூட பார்க்கமுடியாத ஒரு தொலைநோக்கு பார்வை கொண்ட நம் முன்னோர்களை நினைத்து பிரமிக்காமல் இருக்க முடியவில்லை.
06/12/15, 10:23 PM - natarajan ramu: RSS பற்றி ஒரு முஸ்லீம் பெண்ணின் கருத்து
=====================
கண்ணீர் துளிகளை காணிக்கையாக்குகிறேன்..!!!
இன்று பிரசவ வேதனையில் துடித்த பெண் எமனிடம் சென்று திரும்ப வந்ததாகத்தான் நான் நினைக்கிறேன், இது வரை சமூக வலைதளங்களிலும், ஊடகங்களிலும் சொன்னது போல கையில் சூலாயுதத்தோடும், காவி அடையாளத்துடனும் ஆர்.எஸ்.எஸ் சேவகர்கள் இல்லை. எங்கள் பகுதியில் மீட்பு பணியில் ஈடுபட்ட. ஆர்.எஸ்.எஸ் தொண்டர்கள் எங்களுக்கு கடவுளின் பிள்ளைகளாகவே தெரிந்தார்கள். எங்களை இதுவரை ஏமாற்றிய TNTJ, தமுமுக, SDPI இயக்கத்தினர் வெள்ளம்பாதித்த பகுதியில் காணவில்லை, ஆனால் அவர்கள் கெட்டவர்கள் என்று சொன்ன ஆர்.எஸ்.எஸ் தொண்டர்கள் தான் இரவு பகல் பாராமல் அவர்கள் குடும்பத்தார்கள் பாதித்ததை போன்று அக்கரையுடன் உதவுகிறார்கள்.
ராணுவம், போலிஸ் செல்ல தயங்கிய பகுதிகளுக்கு கூட ஆர்.எஸ்.எஸ் தொண்டர்கள் பயப்படாமல் போகிறார்கள், பெண்கள், குழந்தைகள், வயதானவர்கள், அவர்களின் உடமைகளையும் பாதுகாப்பாக மீட்பது, இறந்த சடலத்தை தூக்குவது, உணவுதயாரித்து விநியோகம் செய்வது.
கடவுளே ஆண்கள் மட்டுமா ஆர்.எஸ்.எஸ் பெண்களும் மீட்புபணியில், வெட்கி தலைகுனிந்தேன், இளகிய மணம் படைத்த இவர்களையா காவி தீவிரவாதிகள் என்று இஸ்லாமியர்கள் சொன்னதை நம்பினேன். இன்று தங்கி இருக்கும் திருவல்லிக்கேணி பார்த்தசாரதி கோயிலில் மானசீகமாய் கடவுள் பெருமாளிடம் மண்ணிப்பு கேட்கிறேன் என்னை மன்னித்து விடுங்கள் ‪#‎கடவுளே‬

A doctor from Mumbai shared this .

Dear Sir,

In 2005, we had in Mumbai, similar type of torrential rains.  The entire city had become a big pond like today's Chennai.  During those days, many people became victim of fatal decease called "Laptospirosis" caused through dead rats drowned in the logged drain waters.
So, Chennai may please ensure to clean their hands and feet by disinfecting soaps/hand wash after returning home from any outing for the next few days.
Please share this with Chennai People, you may know.

12/12/15, 8:10 PM - Prasanna Natarajan: 👇Read this very interesting☺
One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. 
After the cut, he asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money from you, I'm doing community service this week.

 The florist was pleased and left the shop. 

When the barber went to open his shop the next morning, there was a 'Thank You' card and a dozen roses waiting for him at his door. 

Later, a grocer comes in for a haircut, and when he tried to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you , I'm doing community service this week.

The grocer was happy and left the shop. 

The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a 'Thank You' card and a bag of fresh vegetables waiting for him at his door.

Then a politician came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you. I'm doing community service this week.

 The politician was very happy and left the shop. 

The next morning, when the barber went to open up, 
The shop name was changed to AMMA saloon with her face on the Board.

And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between the citizens of Tamilnadu and the politicians who run Tamilnadu.

If you don't forward this, nothing bad will happen. 
But someone will miss a good laugh 😀👍

“Cow is just an animal like a hen or goat... then why should one not kill and eat it?”

Cow is also an animal, but... a cow has many specialities that no other animal (not even human beings) has in this world. This is the reason that Hindus consider cow as ‘mother’ after their own mother, and pray to the cow with respect calling it “go-matha”.

These are some truths about go-matha.

·  If a cow eats something poisonous by mistake, and we drink its milk, will we fall ill? To find out, one cow was regularly fed a particular quantity of a poison every day. After 24 hours, its blood, urine, dung and milk were tested in a lab to check where the poison could be found. In this way, the tests were done not for 1 or 2 days, but continuously for 90 days in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi. The researcher did not find any trace of poison in milk, blood, urine or dung of that cow.

Then where did this poison fed for 90 days go? Just like Lord Shiva held poison in his throat, the go-matha hid the entire poison in her throat. This is a special quality that no other animal has.

·  This is the only creature that inhales oxygen and also exhales oxygen.

· Cow milk has the quality of countering poison.

·  There are diseases that medical science has not yet understood; urine of Go-matha has the power to cure them

·  If cow-ghee and rice are cooked together, two powerful gases called ethylene-oxide, propylene-oxide are released. Propylene-oxide is the best gas used for creating artificial rain.

·  Cow-urine is the world’s best killer of microbes

·  With medicines made using cow dung and cow urine, stomach-related ailments can be cured.

·  We can save ourselves from radio-waves by plastering the home floors and area outside home with cow-dung

· Cow-dung has the power to destroy the microbes causing cholera

· If 10 grams of cow-ghee is put in fire (yagnya), 1 ton of oxygen is generated.

12/12/15, 10:27 PM - natarajan ramu: Important learning from Chennai floods: 

Millions of personal documents of people have been lost or damaged. Important papers like Insurance Certificates and Medical Records are lost or destroyed. In panic, fleeing people have abandoned them.

Solution: Digitizing your documents.

Please scan and store the following documents for you and each family member in a Pen Drive and email to itself n family members.. Whenever you add another document, please scan it too and save it in the Pen Drive. The Pen Drive can be kept inside a small Ziplock pouch. Make a few copies of the Pen Drive and keep them in very safe places, so that even if one is lost/damaged, you still have copies.

The documents list:

1. Passport, including Visa Pages
2. Insurance Certificates for Life Insurance 
3. Insurance Certificates for Medical Insurance
4. Birth Certificate
5. School Certificates
6. Degree Certificates
7. Fixed Deposit Certificates
8. Important Medical Documents, including medical prescriptions for elderly family members 
9. Driving License
10. Aadhar Card
11. Ration Card
12. Voter I'D
13. PAN Card
14. Previous years Income Tax returns 
15. Property Papers for home, farm arc
16. Vehicle Insurance papers
17. Vehicle Registrations and Tax tokens
17. Warranty Papers for important items
18. Any other Insurance Papers like Home Insurance, Mobile Insurance arc
19. Prescription Lenses for Eyes
20. Employment Record, including Appointment Orders for previous companies, Salary Slips, Releiving Letters arc

Never know when a systematic document preservation system will suddenly be helpful. This need not be needed only during calamities, they may be needed even in normal life situations.

Over the past few days, I saw so many people regretting for not keeping their documents safe. 
Take care.😊👆👍👍

14/12/15, 1:23 PM - natarajan ramu: மக்கள் செல்வத்தை அள்ளித்தரும் - நிலக்கடலை.! 

நீங்கள் அறிந்திராத தகவல்கள்.!

நம் நாட்டில் நிலக்கடலை சாகுபடி செய்யப்பட்டிருக்கும் வயலில் அது கொட்டை வைக்கும் பருவம் வரை வயலில் எலிகள் அவ்வளவாக இருக்காது. 

ஆனால் நிலக்கடலை காய்பிடிக்கும் பருவத்துக்கு பிறகு எலிகள் அளவு கடந்து குட்டி போட்டிருப்பதை காணலாம். நிலக்கடலை செடியை சாப்பிடும் ஆடு, மாடு, நாய், வயல் வெளியே சுற்றி உள்ள பறவைகள் எல்லாம் ஒரே நேரத்தில் குட்டி போடுவது இதற்கு நல்ல உதாரணம்.

நிலக்கடலையில் போலிக் ஆசிட் அதிகம் இருப்பதால் இனப்பெருக்கம் விரைவாக நடக்கிறது. எனவே நிலக் கடலையை தொடர்ந்து சாப்பிடும் பெண்களின் கர்பப்பை சீராக செயல்படுவதுடன் கர்பப்பைக் கட்டிகள், நீர்கட்டிகள் ஏற்படாதது மட்டுமல்லாது குழந்தைப் பேறும் உடன் உண்டாகும்.

நீரழிவு நோயை தடுக்கும்:

நிலக்கடலையில் மாங்கனீஸ் சத்து நிறைய உள்ளது. மாங்கனீஸ் சத்துமாவுச்சத்து மற்றும் கொழுப்புகள் மாற்றத்தில் முக்கிய பங்காற்றுகிறது. 

நாம் உண்ணும் உணவில் இருந்து கால்சியம் நமது உடலுக்கு கிடைக்கவும் பயன்படுகிறது. குறிப்பாக பெண்கள் நிலக்கடலையை தொடர்ந்து சாப்பிட்டு வந்தால் எலும்புத்துளை நோய் வராமல் பாதுகாத்துக் கொள்ளலாம்.

பித்தப் பை கல்லைக் கரைக்கும்:

நிலக்கடலையை தினமும் 30 கிராம் அளவுக்கு தினமும் சாப்பிட்டு வந்தால் பித்தப்பை கல் உருவாவதைத் தடுக்க முடியும். 20 வருடம் தொடர்ந்து நடத்தப்பட்ட ஆய்வில் இந்த தகவல் தெரியவந்துள்ளது.

இதயம் காக்கும்:

நிலக் கடலை சாப்பிட்டால் எடை போடும் என்று நாம் நினைக்கிறோம். உண்மையல்ல. மாறாக உடல் எடை அதிகமாகாமல் இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று நினைப்பவர்களும் நிலக்கடலை சாப்பிடலாம்.

நிலக்கடலையில் ரெஸ்வரெட்ரால் என்ற சத்து நிறைந்துள்ளது. இது இதய வால்வுகளை பாதுகாக்கிறது. இதய நோய்கள் வருவதையும் தடுக்கிறது. இதுவே மிகச் சிறந்த ஆண்டி ஆக்சிடென்டாக திகழ்கிறது.

இளமையை பராமரிக்கும்

இது இளமையை பராமரிக்க பெரிதும் உதவுகிறது. நிலக்கடலையில் பாலிபீனால்ஸ் என்ற ஆண்டி ஆக்சிடென்ட் உள்ளது. இது நமக்கு நோய்வருவதை தடுப்பதுடன் இளமையை பராமரிக்கவும் பயன்படுகிறது.

ஞாபக சக்தி அதிகரிக்கும்:

நிலக்கடலை மூளை வளர்ச்சிக்கு நல்ல டானிக் போன்றது. நிலக்கடலையில் மூளை வளர்ச்சிக்கு பயன்படும் விட்டமின் 3 நியாசின் உள்ளது. இது மூளை வளர்ச்சிக்கும் ஞாபக சக்திக்கும் பெரிதும் பயனளிக்கிறது. ரத்த ஓட்டத்தையும் சீராக்குகிறது.

மன அழுத்தம் போக்கும்:

நிலக்கடையில் பரிப்டோபான் என்ற முக்கிய அமினோ அமிலம் நிறைந்துள்ளது. இந்த வகை அமினோ அமிலம் செரட் டோனின் என்ற மூளையை உற்சாகப்படுத்தும். 

உயிர் வேதிப் பொருள் உற்பத்திக்கு பயன்படுகிறது. செரட்டோனின் மூளை நரம்புகளை தூண்டுகிறது. மனஅழுத்தத்தை போக்குகிறது. நிலக்கடைலையை தொடர்ந்து சாப்பிடுவோருக்கு மன அழுத்தத்தைப் போக்குகிறது.

கொழுப்பை குறைக்கும்:

தலைப்பை படிப்பவர்களுக்கு ஆச்சரியம் ஏற்படலாம். ஆனால் அதுதான் உண்மை. நிலக்கடலை சாப்பிட்டால் கொழுப்பு சத்து அதிகமாகும் என்று நம்மில் பலரும் நினைத்திருப்போம். ஆனால் அதில் உண்மையில்லை. மாறாக மனிதனுக்கு நன்மை செய்யும் கொழுப்பு தான் நிலக்கடலையில்உள்ளது.

நிலக்கடலையில் உள்ள தாமிரம் மற்றும் துத்தநாக சத்தானது நமது உடலின் தீமை செய்யும் கொழுப்பை குறைத்து நன்மை செய்யும் கொழுப்பை அதிகமாக்குகிறது. 

100 கிராம் நிலக்கடலையில் 24 கிராம்மோனோ அன் சாச்சுரேட்டேட் வகை கொழுப்பு உள்ளது. பாலிஅன்சாச்சுரேட்டேடு 16 கிராம் உள்ளது.

இந்த இருவகை கொழுப்புமே நமது உடம்புக்கு நன்மை செய்யும் கொழுப்பாகும். பாதாமை விட நிலக்கடலையில் நன்மை செய்யும் கொழுப்பு அதிகமாக உள்ளது. 

நிலக்கடலையில் உள்ள ஒமேகா-3 சத்தானது நமது உடலின் நோய் எதிர்ப்பு சக்தியை அதிகரிக்கிறது.

அமெரிக்கர்களை கவர்ந்த நிலக்கடலை:

உலக அளவில் சீனாவிற்கு அடுத்து இந்தியாவில்தான் நிலக்கடலை அதிகம் உற்பத்தி செய்யப்படுகிறது. 

இவ்விரு நாடுகளின் மக்கள்பெருக்கத்திற்கும் நிலக்கடலை முக்கிய காரணமாகும். இந்தியாவில் குழந்தைப் பேறுக்கான மருந்துகளின் விற்பனை வாய்ப்புக்கு நிலக்கடலை உண்ணும் வழக்கம் தடையாக இருக்கிறது மற்றும் சில இதய நோய்க்கான மருந்துகளை விற்பனை செய்ய முடியவில்லை. 

எனவே இந்தியர்களிடம் நிலக்கடலை குறித்து தவறான தகவல்களை பரப்பி நிலக்கடலை மற்றும் நிலக்கடலை எண்ணெய் வகைகளை பயன்படுத்துவதை தடுத்துவிட்டார்கள். 

இதன் காரணமாக குழந்தையில்லாத தம்பதிகள் பெருகிவிட்டார்கள்.

கடந்த 20 வருடமாக இந்தியாவில் நிலக்கடலையின் விலை பெரியமாற்றம் ஏதும் இல்லாமல் ஒரே விலையில் விற்பனை செய்யப்படுகிறது. 

ஆனால் இதே கால கட்டத்தில் அமெரிக்கர்களின் உணவில் நிலக்கடலையின் பங்கு 15 மடங்கு கூடி இருப்பதுடன் விலையும் கூடிஇருக்கிறது.

இந்தியர்கள் அனைவரும் நிலக்கடலை சாப்பிட ஆரம்பித்தால் அமெரிக்கர்கள் நிலக்கடலை அதிகம் விலை கொடுத்து சாப்பிட வேண்டும் என்று கருதிதான் இந்தியர்களிடம் நிலக்கடலை குறித்து தவறான தகவல்

05/01/16, 9:13 AM - natarajan ramu: A JUDGE OF THE GUJARAT HIGH COURT FACES IMPEACHMENT BY PARLIAMENT :

A Parsi high court judge made the following remarks in his recent judgement. Unfortunately our law makers are going to impeach him for this para. Let's see what he said and decide. 

If I am asked by any one to name two things, which has destroyed this country or rather, has not allowed the country, to progress in the right direction, then the same is, (i) Reservation and (ii) Corruption. It is very shameful for any citizen of this country to ask for reservation after 65 years of independence. When our Constitution was framed, it was understood that the reservation would remain for a period of 10 years, but unfortunately, it has continued even after 65 years of independence. The biggest threats, today, for the country is corruption. The countrymen should rise and fight against corruption at all levels, rather than shedding blood and indulging in violence for the reservation. The reservation has only played the role of an amoeboid monster sowing seeds of discord amongst the people. The importance of merit, in any society, cannot be understated. The merit stands for a positive goal and when looked at instrumentally, stands for “rewarding those actions that are considered good”. Then, this instrumental nature of merit that should be given importance – emphasizing on and rewarding merit is a means towards achieving what is regarded as good in the society. The parody of the situation is that India must be the only country wherein some of the citizens crave to be called backward.

One has to wonder why is going to be impeached by MPs (mostly Congress MPs) . If you don't believe this news, here is the link. http://deshgujarat.com/2015/12/18/58-mps-move-motion-to-impeach-gujarat-high-court-judge/

You don't have to candle march to support the judge. Just spread the word by sharing this with your whatsapp friend, if you can. That's minimum we can do to keep our judiciary independent.

07/01/16, 10:14 AM - natarajan ramu: Sad but true 


A teacher after the dinner she started checking homework done by the students. Her husband is strolling around with a smart phone playing his favourite game ‘Candy Crush Saga’.

When reading the last note, the wife starts crying with silent tears.

Her husband saw this and asked, ‘Why are you crying dear? What happened?’

Wife: ‘Yesterday I gave homework to my 1st Standard students, to write something on topic -My Wish-.’

Husband: ‘OK, but why are you crying?’

Wife: ‘Today while checking the last note, it makes me crying.’

Husband curiously: ‘What’s written in the note that makes you crying?’

Wife: ‘Listen’

My wish is to become a smart phone.

My parents love smart phone very much.

They care smart phone so much that sometimes they forget to care me.

When my father comes from office tired, he has time for smart phone but not for me.

When my parents are doing some important work and smart phone is ringing, within single ring they attend the phone, but not me even...

even if I am crying.


They play games on their smart phones not with me.

When they are talking to someone on their smart phone, they never listen to me even if I am telling something important.

So, My wish is to become a smart phone.

After listening the note husband got emotional and asked the wife, ‘who wrote this?’.

Wife: ‘Our son’.

Gadgets are beneficial, but they are for our ease not to cease the love amongst family and loved ones.


Children see and feel everything what happens with & around them. Things get imprinted on their mind with an everlasting effect. Let’s take due care, so that they do not grow with any false impressions.

09/01/16, 7:40 AM - natarajan ramu: What a nice story...
(Copied and pasted here.)
An American man walked into a restaurant in London. As soon as he entered, he noticed an African man sitting in the corner.
So he walked over to the counter, removed his wallet and shouted, "Waiter! I am buying food for everyone in this restaurant, except that black African guy over there!"
So the waiter collected the money from the man and began serving free food to everyone in the restaurant, except the African.
However,insteadof becoming upset, the African simply looked up at the American and
shouted, "Thank you!" That infuriated the man. So once again, the American took out his wallet and shouted, "Waiter! This time I am buying bottles of wine and additional food for everyone in this bar, except for that African sitting in the corner over there!" So the waiter collected the money from the man and began serving free food and wine to
everyone in the bar except the African.
When the waiter finished serving the food and drinks, once again, instead of becoming angry, the African simply smiled at the American man and shouted, "Thank you!"
That made the American man furious. So he leaned over on the counter and said to the
waiter, "What is wrong with that African man? I have bought food and drinks for everyone in this bar except him, but instead of becoming angry, he just sits there and smiles at me and shouts 'Thank you.' Is he
mad???"
The waiter smiled at the American and said, "No, he is not mad. He is the owner of this
restaurant.
May your enemies work unknowingly in your favour.

💬 Stay away from Anger..It hurts ..Only You!
💬 If you are right then there is no need to get angry,
💬 And if you are wrong then you don't have any right to get angry.
💬 Patience with family is love,
💬 Patience with others is respect.
💬 Patience with self is confidence and Patience with GOD is faith.
💬 Never Think Hard about thePAST, It brings Tears...
💬 Don't think more about the FUTURE, It brings Fear...
💬 Live this Moment with a Smile,It brings Cheer.
💬Every test in our life makes us bitter or better,
💬 Every problem comes to make us or break us,
💬 The choice is ours whether we become victims or victorious.
💬 Beautiful things are not always good but good things are always beautiful
💬 Do you know why God created gaps between fingers?
💬 So that someone who is special to you comes and fills those gaps by holding your hand forever.
💬 Happiness keeps You Sweet..But being sweet brings happiness.

Do Share it with all the Good People In ur Life.

14/01/16, 9:10 PM - Bharath Cousin: A rare conversation between Krishna & Today's Arjun

Read it loud to family,

 it's one of  the best message I have come across...

1. Arjun :- I can’t find free time. Life has become hectic.

Krishna:- Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free.

2. Arjun :- Why has life become complicated now?

 Krishna :- Stop analyzing life... It makes it complicated. Just live it.

3. Arjun :- Why are we then constantly unhappy?

Krishna :- Worrying has become your habit. That’s why you are not happy.

4. Arjun :- Why do good people always suffer?

Krishna :- Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don’t suffer.
With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.

5. Arjun :- You mean to say such experience is useful?

Krishna :- Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons later.

6. Arjun :- Because of so many problems, we don’t know where we are heading…

Krishna:- If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.

7. Arjun :- Does failure hurt more than moving in the right direction?

Krishna:- Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you.

8. Arjun :- In tough times, how do you stay motivated?

Krishna :- Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.

9. Arjun :- What surprises you about people?

Krishna :- When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?"

10. Arjun :- How can I get the best out of life?

Krishna:- Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.

11. Arjun :- One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.

Krishna:- There are no unanswered prayers. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.

ரயில்வே பட்ஜெட்டில் சொல்லப்பட்ட திட்டங்கள், அனைத்தும், செயல்முறைக்கு வந்துவிட்டன.

A farmer is on the hill top  with his herd....

A helicopter suddenly lands and a handsome youth comes out.
He approaches the farmer with a swagger and tells him, "if I can tell you accurately the number of cows u have wil u allow me to take one of your calves?"

FARMER thinks and says okay.

The young man presses an app on his smartphone and gets the satellite image on dharwad.indicate where he is, he then sends his co - ordinates to ISRO- which then photographs the area for him. he then calls ISRO to identify all living things in the radius of the hill top and gets an answer 35. He deducts 2 and tells farmer...
you have 33 cows.

Farmer says ok you can have one of my calves.

As the young man is trying to load the animal on to his helicopter, the FARMER says; "if I tell u r name will u return my calf?"

The young guy says ok.

The farmer says : U r RAHUL GANDHI. 

The young man is shocked😳, he says, "how did you know ?"

Farmer says, " its Easy, u came here when no one invited you, u used millions of tax payers money to give me information which I have known for years" 

By the way these are sheep not cows and could u please return my dog...😂😂😂

25/01/16, 10:19 PM - Vidya Perima: 🌼கடவுள் யாரையும் கை‌விடுவ‌தி‌ல்லை🌼

🌼ஒரு நாள் நான் முடிவு செய்தேன் 
இந்த வாழ்க்கையை துறந்துவிடுவது என்று… 

🌼ஆம், 
எனது வேலை, 
எனது உறவுகள், 
என் இறையாண்மை 

🌼அனைத்தையும் விட்டுவிடுவது
 என்று.துறவிகள் போல வாழ்ந்துவிட வேண்டும் என்று முடிவெடுத்து காட்டிற்குச் சென்றேன். 

🌼அப்போது…
கடைசியாக இறைவனிடம் ஒரு சில வார்த்தைகள் பேச விரும்பினேன்.

🌼“கடவுளே, நான் என் வாழ்க்கையை வாழ்வதற்கு ஏதாவது ஒரு காரணம் கூறுங்கள்?”

🌼கடவுளின் பதில் என்னை வியப்பில் ஆழ்த்தியது…

🌼“ஒரு முறை காட்டைச் சுற்றிப் பார். காடு முழுவதும் புதர் செடிகளும் நீண்டு ஓங்கி வளர்ந்துள்ள மூங்கில்களும் காணப்படுகின்றன அல்லவா?”

🌼“ஆமாம்” என்று நான் பதிலளித்தேன்.

🌼“நான் புதர் செடி மற்றும் மூங்கிலு‌க்கான விதைகளை எப்போது விதைத்தேனோ அப்போ‌தி‌ல் இரு‌ந்து அவைகளை மிகவும் பொறுப்புடன் நான் கவனித்து வந்தேன்.

🌼 அவைகளுக்குத் தேவையான வெளிச்சம், தண்ணீர், காற்று என அனைத்தையும் வழங்கினேன்.புதர் செடியின் விதை பூமியில் இருந்து சீக்கிரம் இலைகளை விட்டு வளர்ந்தது. அதன் பச்சை நிறம் பூமியை அலங்கரிக்கும் விதமாக அமைந்தது. 

🌼ஆனால் அப்போது மூங்கில் விதையில் இருந்து எந்த முன்னேற்றமும் இல்லை. ஆனாலும் அதனை நான் கைவிடவில்லை.

🌼இரண்டாவது ஆண்டும் வந்தது. புதர் செடி வேர் விட்டு பரவலாக வளர்ந்து இருந்தது. ஆனாலும் மூங்கில் விதையில் இருந்து ஒரு இலை கூட வந்திருக்கவில்லை. ஆனாலும் நான் அதனை கைவிட்டு விடவில்லை” என்றார் கடவுள்.

🌼“மூன்றாவது ஆண்டும், நான்காவது ஆண்டும் கழிந்தன. எந்த முன்னேற்றமும் இல்லை. ஆனாலும் நான் அதனை மறந்துவிடவில்லை.

🌼ஐந்தாம் ஆண்டு வந்தது. மூங்கில் விதை மூளைத்து இரண்டு இலைகள் பூமியை பிளந்து கொண்டு வெளியில் வந்திருந்தது. 

🌼அது புதர் செடியை விட மிகச் சிறியதாகவும், சாதாரணமாகவும் இருந்தது.

🌼ஆனால் 6 மாதம் கழித்து மூங்கில்கள் ஓங்கி உயர்ந்து வளர்ந்தன. பார்க்கவே கம்பீரமாக இருந்தன” என்றார்.

🌼“இத்தனை ஆண்டு கால‌த்‌தி‌ல் மூ‌ங்‌கி‌ல் விதை செத்துவிடவில்லை.தான் வாழ்வதற்குத் தேவையான அளவிற்கு வேர்களை பரப்பியிருந்தது. அந்த வேர்களும் நன்கு உறுதியாக மாறியது. 

🌼பின்னர்தான் தனது வளர்ச்சியை மூங்கில் விதை துவக்கியது.

🌼எனது படைப்புகளுக்கு பல்வேறு சவால்களை சந்திக்கும் சக்தியை நான் கொடுத்திருக்கிறேன். அவற்றால் கையாள முடியாத பிரச்சினைகளை அவற்றுக்கு நான் எப்போதும் கொடுப்பதில்லை” எ‌ன்று சா‌ந்தமாக ப‌தில‌ளி‌த்தா‌ர்.

🌼மேலும் கடவுள் என்னிடம், 

🌼“உனக்கு ஒன்று தெரியுமா குழந்தாய், 

🌼நீ எப்போதெல்லாம் பிரச்சினைகளை சந்தித்தாயோ, துன்பப்பட்டாயோ அப்போதெல்லாம் நீ வேர் விட்டு வளர்ந்து கொண்டிருந்தாய். மூங்கில் விதையையும் நான் விட்டுவிடவில்லை. உன்னையும் நான் விட்டுவிட மாட்டேன். 

🌼மற்றவர்களுடன் உன்னை ஒருபோதும் ஒப்பிட்டுப் பார்க்காதே. 

🌼ஒருவேளை அவர்கள் வெறும் முட்புதர்களாகக் கூட இருப்பார்கள்” என்றார்.

🌼“மூங்கிலும், புதர் செடிகளும் காட்டினை அலங்கரிப்பவைதான். ஆனா‌ல் இரண்டும் வெவ்வேறானவை என்பதை புரிந்து கொள்ள வேண்டும்” என்றார்.

🌼இறுதியாக, 
“உன்னுடைய நேரம் வந்துவிட்டது. நீ வளர்வதற்கான நேரம் இதுதான்”

🌼நான் கேட்டேன், “என்னால் எவ்வளவு தூரம் வளர முடியும்?”

🌼“மூங்கில் வளரும் அளவிற்கு உன்னாலும் வளர முடியும்” என்று நம்பிக்கை அளித்தார் கடவுள்.

🌼“எவ்வளவு தூரம் மூங்கில் வளரும்” என்று கேள்வி எழுப்பினேன் நான்.
“அதனால் எவ்வளவு முடியுமோ அவ்வளவு வளரும்” என்றார் அவர்.

🌼“அதனால் எவ்வளவு முடியுமோ அவ்வளவு உயரமா?” என்று வியந்தேன் நான்.

🌼“ஆம். அதுபோல நீயும் உன்னால் எவ்வளவு முடியுமோ அந்த அளவிற்கு முன்னேற முடியும்” என்று கூறி மறைந்தார்.

🌼நான் காட்டில் இருந்து நம்பிக்கையுடன் புறப்பட்டேன். 

🌼மீண்டும் இந்த கதைக்கே திரும்பினேன்.

🌼ஆம், இது உங்களையும் முன்னேற்ற உதவும் என்று நம்புகிறேன்.

🌼கடவுள் எப்போதும், யாரையும் கைவிடுவதில்லை🌼

26/01/16, 8:37 PM - Pornima Akka: GOD'S TIMING. 
👼👼👼👼👼👼👼


After Sept. 11th attack , one company invited the remaining members of other companies who had been decimated by the attack on the Twin Towers to share their available office space. At a morning meeting, the head of security told stories of why these people were alive…... and all the stories were just the 'L I T T L E' things. 

As you might know, the head of the company survived that day because his son started kindergarten.

Another fellow was alive because it was his turn to bring donuts. One woman was late because her alarm clock didn't go off in time. 

One of them missed his bus. One spilled food on her clothes and had to take time to change.
One's car wouldn't start.

One went back to answer the telephone.

One had a child that dawdled and didn't get ready as soon as he should have. 

One couldn't get a taxi.

The one that struck me was the man who put on a new pair of shoes that morning, took the various means to get to work but before he got there, he developed a blister on his foot.
He stopped at a drugstore to buy a Band-Aid.
That is why he is ALIVE today. 

Now when I am stuck in traffic, miss an elevator, turn back to answer a ringing telephone...
All the little things that annoy me.
I think to myself, this is exactly where God wants me to be at this very moment...

Next time
Ur morning seems to be going wrong,
The children are slow getting dressed,
U can't seem to find the car keys,
U hit every traffic light, don't get mad or frustrated.
God is at work watching over u. 
May God continue to bless u with all those annoying little things & may u remember their possible purpose.

Live Life Always Being Thankful..
With Attitude of Gratitude ....😊

29/01/16, 3:52 PM - Paiya perrippa: Amazing pic. Abdul Raheem an afghan soldier who lost both his hands in war, received a pair of hands from Joseph of Kerala who had a brain death. The wife and daughter are looking at the hands that once caressed them. Surgery was performed by Dr Subramanian Iyer (blue shirt) of Amrita Hospital Kerala. A hindu doctor - a christian organ donor - a muslim recepient. That's humanity.
30/01/16, 9:34 AM - Paiya perrippa: Who invented Idli?

It seems to be a funny question but relevant now. The World Health Organization listed Idli as one of the most hygienic and nutritious food. It is the favourite breakfast of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Along with Sambar, Idli nourishes us.

 Then how it originated? Very interesting to note that, “Idli” is the modified form of “Kedli” of Indonesia. The story goes like this… Fermented food especially Kedli is the most favourite food of Indonesia. Once a Hindu King of Indonesia visited South India during 8 th century looking for Bride. The cooks accompanied the King prepared Kedli to serve him. The Indian cooks studied the preparation of Kedli and modified according to their imagination. Originally, the Idli was a preparation of fermented Blackgram pulp but later rice also added to fasten the fermentation process.

In India, Idli originated in Karnataka according to the writing Vaddaradhane of Sivakoty Acharya of 920 AD. It describes Idli as one of the 18 items served to a Brahmachari visited in homes. In Tamil Nadu, the" Ittali" originated around 17th century AD.

Whether imported from Indonesia or invented in India, it’s worth noting that Idli fulfills the needs of a fasting stomach. It gives carbohydrates for energy and protein for growth. Its good bacteria generate lot of Vitamin B. An interesting thing is that a person consuming Idli daily will not have head ache because the black gram has the property to inhibit head ache. The side dish Sambar is one of the nutritious vegetable soup that contains many vegetables, spices, tamarind, Asafoetida etc which keeps the stomach healthy and prevents acidity and indigestion. Idli is all protein no fat .
30/01/16, 11:20 AM - Pornima Akka: 👌🏻idli is my fav

30/01/16, 2:31 PM - natarajan ramu: The 4 Important News that media should have been specially covered this week,  but were not at all mentioned by Press, hand in hand with Congress, as they are busy in terrorising people with  news of intolerance, creating situations of suicide and such silly childish gimmicks. 

The FOUR IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE: 

1. World Bank has appreciated our Prime Minister Narendra Modi's favourite Project 'CLEAN INDIA' and announced support of 1.5 Billion Dollars for the project. 

2.  The 'Nuclear Energy Agreement' between India & Japan has been applauded by 'IEA- Inventions for Energy Alternatives' supporting Solar Energy Exploration and announced that with this collaboration India will achieve a GREAT MILESTONE in the use of solar energy that will be exemplary to the whole world. 

3. Within the next one year GOOGLE is going to provide Free Wifi Service in 100 Railway Stations and are going to train 20 Lakh Android Developers which means that 20 Lakh Youth will get the JOB OPPORTUNITY. 

4. Henceforth CBSC Books will be available online for FREE. Central Minister Smriti Irani has planned this special project. 

When media and News Papers have lost their CONSCIOUS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, We have to take this responsibility to reach this message to maximum VOTERS REGARDING THE PROSPECTS NAMO GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING FOR THEM. 
I am sure you will also carry out this responsibility as I have done by sharing this message with you.
We have responsibility towards Future Of India.

31/01/16, 9:42 AM - Pornima Akka: Here's one on Attitude & Confidence 

One night President Obama and his wife Michelle decided to do somesthing out of routine and go for a casual dinner at a restaurant that wasn’t too luxurious.

When they were seated, the owner of the restaurant asked the President’s secret service if he could please speak to the First Lady in private.

They obliged and Michelle had a conversation with the owner.

After the conversation President Obama asked Michelle,
 “Why was he so interested
 in talking to you?”

She mentioned that in her teenage years, 
he had been madly in love with her.

President Obama then said, 
“So if you had married him, you would now be the owner of this lovely restaurant?”

Michelle responded, “No, 
if I had married him, 
he would now be the President.”

A WOMAN’s CONFIDENCE NEVER COMES IN BITS & PIECES.😉

08/02/16, 10:21 PM - Pornima Akka: Einstein & an Indian sitting next to each other on a long flight...

Einstein says:
"Let's play a game...
I will ask you a question,
if you don't know the answer,
you pay me only $5
and
if I don't know the answer,
I will pay you $500..."

Einstein asks the first question:
What's the distance from the Earth to the Moon...?

The Indian  doesn't say a word,
Reaches his pocket,
Pulls out a $5...

Now...
It's the Indian's  turn...

He asks Einstein:
What goes up a hill with 3 legs
and
comes down on 4 legs..?

Einstein does some calculations and develops some algorithms ......
After an hour he gives the Indian $500...

Einstein is going nuts and asks:
Well...
so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four..?

Indian reaches his pocket and gives Einstein $5...

Einstein fainted.....
😝

Moral:
You may be Einstein, but never under estimate an Indian 😜😀 😎

3) Very Special bhelpuri Rs 15 
4) Extra Special bhelpuri Rs 16
5) Double Extra Special bhelpuri Rs.20
6) Sunday Special bhelpuri Rs 25
(Sunday only)

To check each & every Bhelpuri for its different taste, I started eating everyday a different one. . . . .

But soon I discovered that each & every one had  the same taste of Bhelpuri.

Finally one day I asked him the reason for the same taste?
💷 💵 💴

Belwala said: bhelpuri cost. . . . Rs 10

Special bhelpuri means spoons washed ... 🍴

Very Special bhelpuri means spoon and plates both washed ... 🍛🍴


Extra Special bhelpuri means washing hands before putting the  Bhel in washed plates & served with washed spoons... 👏

Double Extra Special bhelpuri means clean drinking water is provided separately ... 💧
 
Saying this he fell silent.

Then I asked What is Sunday Special?

Belwala said : Sunday ... That's the day I take bath.....

Riddle goes like this :

1. Jnu students were protesting against the hanging of afzal guru.

2. Afzal guru was hanged during UPA govt. on 9 February 2013.

3. Rahul baba comes out in support of jnu students knowing that they were actually protesting against his parties decision.

4. Jnu students readily accept rahul Baba's support knowing that he is the representative of the govt who hanged afzal.

5. Innocent students,commie, presstitutes everyone seems happy.

Who turns out to be the villain ?

Modi/BJP/RSS..

By which perverse logic and how..??

17/02/16, 11:08 AM - natarajan ramu: 🇨🇭MUST CIRCULATE🇨🇭

Recently, one person was admitted to a nursing home at Dharwad, due to severe chest pain. He had an earlier attack  in 2012 and was under treatment. The doctors now suggested Angiography. 
  
Upon undergoing Angiography at multi speciality Hospital  Doctors diagnosed multiple blockages for which Angioplasty was ruled out and instead,  suggested 'Bypass Surgery'. 

That evening, he was brought home as  doctor suggested his heart being very weak, bypass could be performed only after 10 - 15 days. 
  
Meanwhile, after discussing the matter with relatives and close friends, fresh  information came from a family friend. 
  
A new treatment known as-"Chelation Therapy" has been introduced into the Indian medical theatre. 
  
With this therapy, a patient who has to undergo by-pass need not do so.

Instead, the patient is given about 30 bottles of IV fluids in which certain medicament are injected. The medicine cleans the system and removes all blockages from the heart and the arteries. The number of bottles given may increase depending upon the age-factor and health of the patient. 
Cost per bottle may be around Rs.1,500/- .

Currently, only a few doctors in India specialise in this field

One of them is DR. C Shashikant (Dharwad)

He has a list of patients who had to undergo by-pass from major hospitals; but, instead after undergoing the new treatment, they are absolutely fine and are leading a normal life. 
Doctor's details for your info are:

19/02/16, 11:05 AM - Paiya perrippa: Bheeshma  Ekadasi and Vishnusahasranama Jayanthy are observed on February 18, Thursday .
Bheeshma Ekadasi is observed in the Magha Month (January – February) in South India . In 2016, the date of Bhishma Ekadasi in India is February 18. It is believed that the Vishnu Sahasranama Stothram (thousand names dedicated to Lord Vishnu) was revealed to the Pandavas on this day by Bhisma, who was lying in a bed of arrows after the Great War in Mahabharat.

This particular period in traditional Hindu calendar has numerous auspicious dates dedicated to Bhishma. Some of the important days are Bhishma Ashtami, Bhisma Dwadasi and Bhishma Ekadasi. It is believed that Bhishma chose this period to leave his body and merge with the Supreme Soul (Brahman). 

The Vishnu Sahasranama Stothram was revealed to Pandavas by Bhishma in the presence of Lord Krishna, who is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.

It is believed that listening to Vishnu Sahasranama Stothram leads to Moksha.

21/02/16, 7:51 AM - Paiya perrippa: Finally a new law passed by Modi Govt today. As per Indian Penal Code 233. If a girl is suspected to be raped or getting raped, then she has the supreme right to kill the man, or harm that person as dangerously and girl won't be blamed for murder. Tell as many as you can its your power create awareness. Share this as many as you can

1. What should a woman do if she finds herself alone in the company of a strange male as she prepares to enter a lift in a High Rise apartment late at night?

Experts Say: Enter the lift. If you need to reach the 13th floor, press all the buttons up to your destination. No one will dare attack you in a lift that stops on every floor.

2. What to do if a stranger tries to attack you when you are alone in your house, run into the kitchen. 

Experts Say: You alone know where the chili powder and turmeric are kept. And where the knives and plates are. All these can be turned into deadly weapons. If nothing else, start throwing plates and utensils all over. Let them break. Scream. Remember that noise is the greatest enemy of a molester. He does not want to be caught.

3. Taking an Auto or Taxi at Night. 

Experts Say: Before getting into an auto at night, note down its registration number. Then use the mobile to call your family or friend and pass on the details to them in the language the driver understands. Even if no one answers your call, pretend you are in a conversation. The driver now knows someone has his details and he will be in serious trouble if anything goes wrong. He is now bound to take you home safe and sound. A potential attacker is now your de facto protector.

4. What if the driver turns into a street he is not supposed too and you feel you are entering a danger zone? 
Experts Say: Use the handle of your purse or your stole (dupatta) to wrap around his neck and pull him back. Within seconds, he will feel choked and helpless. In case you don’t have a purse or stole just pull him back by his collar. The top button of his shirt would then do the same trick.

5. If you are stalked at night. 

Expert Say: enter a shop or a house and explain your predicament. If it is night and shops are not open, go inside an ATM box. ATM centers always have close circuit television. Fearing identification, no one will dare attack you. 

After all, being mentally alert is the greatest weapon you can ever have. 

Please spread it to all those women u care & spread awareness as this is the least we can do for a social & moral cause and for the safety of our women. 

Guys please forward it to your moms, sisters, wives and female friends. Better safe than sorry friends. Plzz frwrd to all grls u know.....👍

To All the women
22/02/16, 10:00 AM - natarajan ramu: A naked fact ..................... Ant and Grasshopper - Indian Version of story - too good and fact


Original Story:

The Ant works hard in the withering heat all summer building its house and
laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks the Ant is a fool
and laughs dances plays the summer away. Come winter, the Ant is warm and well fed. The Grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.
       ..........................

Indian Version:

The Ant works hard in the withering heat all summer building its house and
laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks the Ant's a fool and laughs dances plays the summer away.

Come winter, the shivering Grasshopper calls a press conference and demands
to know why the Ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.

NDTV, BBC, CNN , Asianet show up to provide pictures of the shivering Grasshopper
next to a video of the Ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.

The World is stunned by the sharp contrast.

How can this be that this poor Grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

Arundhati Roy stages a demonstration in front of the Ant's house.

Medha Patkar goes on a fast along with other Grasshoppers demanding that Grasshoppers be relocated to warmer climates during winter .

Mayawati states this as 'injustice' done on Minorities.

 
The Internet is flooded with online petitions seeking support to the Grasshopper


CPM in Kerala immediately passes a law preventing Ants from working hard in the heat so as to bring about equality of poverty among Ants and
Grasshoppers.

Railway minister allocates one free coach to Grasshoppers on all Indian Railway Trains, aptly named as the 'Grasshopper Rath'.

Finally, the Judicial Committee drafts the 'Prevention of Terrorism Against Grasshoppers Act'[POTAGA] , with effect from the beginning of the winter..

Education minister makes 'Special Reservation' for Grasshoppers in Educational
Institutions in Government Services.

The Ant is fined for failing to comply with POTAGA and having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, it's home is confiscated by Government
and handed over to the Grasshopper in a ceremony covered by NDTV, BBC, CNN.

Arundhati Roy calls it 'A Triumph of Justice'.

Railway minister calls it 'Socialistic Justice'.

CPM calls it 'Revolutionary Resurgence of Downtrodden'

.
.
.
.

Many years later...

The Ant has since migrated to the US and set up a multi-billion dollar company in Silicon Valley ,

100s of Grasshoppers still die of starvation despite reservation somewhere in India ,

....AND

As a result of losing lot of hard working Ants and feeding the grasshoppers, India is still a developing country...!!

Parsis are just 0.1% of total population, or maybe even less..........YET.........

They never asked for minority status...

They never asked for reservations...

They never f​ight​ with Indian Government...

 They never felt threatened by Hindus...

 They never throw bombs or stones or damage public property...

 They never indulge in crimes or run the underworld...

 All they do is to contribute mightily to the progress of India...

They gave us the best.....

Parsis...They are best gift by Almighty to India...

They are a beautiful People...A beautiful and dignified Race....

I wish we had more of the Parsis who could teach our other greedy minorities as to what minority really means......It means NOT to be parasite or a leech on the host country...It means to give, & NOT to take...


All those who are asking for minority status, then and today, ought to be ashamed of themselves.

You owe a lot to this nation. Pay back, rather than asking from nation.

Kindly circulate. Let it reach to all those who are already minority and to all those who are still asking for

​special status.

05/03/16, 9:42 AM - Paiya perrippa: After the war, Hanumanji submitted his Travel Allowance Bill for his official tour for collecting Sanjeevani Booti to Ayodhya administration. 

The Auditor in Bill Section raised 3 objections : 

(1) Hanumanji did not take prior permission of the appropriate authority (Bharat), the King of Ayodhya, during the relevant time for his travel

(2) Hanumanji being Grade 2-officer was not entitled to air travel; 

(3) Hanumanji was asked to bring Sanjeevani Booti, just a single plant, but he carried a whole mountain (unauthorized excess baggage). 

The Auditor returned the bill. King Ram could do nothing except mark it down for re-examination. 

A worried Hanumanji approached the Auditor and offered a bribe of 20% of the T.A.Bill amount.

The Auditor now wrote on the Bill : 

Re-examined : 
1. Even during the relevant time, Ram was still the king through his Paduka.

2. Further in an emergency, non-entitled officers can be authorized ex-post facto to fly.

3. Also excess baggage is justified as bringing a wrong plant would have entailed multiple journeys with extra cost; hence bill may be paid.

Ram ji shocked !!😳
Accounts department rocks

08/03/16, 1:48 PM - Paiya perrippa: Are you Hurt?

On his first day in office as President, when Abraham Lincoln entered to give his inaugural address, one man stood up. He was a rich Aristocrat. He said, “Mr. Lincoln, you should not forget that your father used to make shoes for my family.” And the whole Senate laughed; they thought they had made a fool of Lincoln.
But certain people are made of a totally different mettle. Lincoln looked at the man directly in the eye and said, “Sir, I know that my father used to make shoes for your family, and there will be many others here. Because he made shoes the way nobody else can, he was a creator. His shoes were not just shoes; he poured his whole soul into them. I want to ask you, have you any complaint? Because I know how to make shoes myself. If you have any complaint I can make you another pair of shoes. But as far as I know, nobody has ever complained about my father’s shoes. He was a genius, a great creator and I am proud of my father”.
The whole Senate was struck dumb. They could not understand what kind of man Abraham Lincoln was. He was proud because his father did his job so well that not even a single complaint had ever been heard.

Remember:
“No one can hurt you without your consent.”
“It is not what happens to us that hurts us. It is our response that hurts us. Be excellent at your work no matter what work you do, Happiness is always yours."

08/03/16, 8:08 PM - Pornima Akka: "My problem with what's happening in the country is not about BJP and Congress, Or JNU and anti-nationalism,  or Jats and reservation, Or Hindu Extrimism and Muslim Extrimism, Or Beef Ban and Porn Ban, Or Kejriwal and Modi, Or Ravish and that 'India wants to know' guy.
My problem is our mindspace being occupied with futile, useless, fruitless, negative, regressive thinking. 
In an age when this country should be thinking of inventions and ideas, we are discussing subjects mentioned above. 
I like Modi's 'Make in India' initiative. Why can't we discuss that and talk about it?
That can be a game changer for this country if the entire nation gets involved in it and if the government practices it and not just makes hoardings out of it.
Why isn't the government and media talking about it?
Why the subject of debate is not development? 
Why isn't RSS talking about it?Why isn't every Hindu talking about it.  
Why aren't the muslims talking about it?
Why the news channels aren't focusing on it?
Why Indians on facebook not discussing it?
Or spreading that idea to the world?
Saffron or Green, Beef or Chicken, Porn or Sanskari channels, Temples or Mosques, Jats or Kashmiris aren't tools of development. These subjects of conversations are anti-development. And anything that's anti-development is anti-national atleast for me.
I want to see my India look better than Switzerland.
I want my India to do better than the US in the Olympics.
I want to see my India more civilzed than the most civilized country in this world.
I want my India to be more innovative than Japan.
I want my India to be more safe for woman than Copenhagen, Denmark.
I want my India to be more open minded than Canada.
I want my India to be better than what it is today. And not worse.
And that can only happen when we start thinking productive.
Else we will all be wasting time doing something that is useless, futile, infertile.
Please circulate this post. I could have used the half an hour I took to write this, as a reaction to what's happening around, for a better purpose".

1984-டிசம்பர் 3-ம் தேதி...!!!

போபால் ரயில்வே ஸ்டேஷனில் 'துருவே' என்ற ஸ்டேஷன் மாஸ்டருக்கு இரவு நேரப் பணி.

போபால் ஸ்டேஷன் வழியாக லக்னோ வில் இருந்து மும்பை செல்லும் ரயிலுக்கு சிக்னல்
கிளியரன்ஸ் கொடுத்துவிட்டு
வெளியே வந்தார்.
அவரால் காற்றில் ஏதோ வித்தியாசத்தை உணர முடிந்தது. அவசர அவசரமாக சிக்னல்
அறைக்கு ஓடினார். 

எப்படியாவது லக்னோ டு
மும்பை ரயிலைத் தடுத்து விடுவதுதான் அவரது
நோக்கம். 

ஆனால், அந்த ரயில்
ஏற்கெனவே கிளம்பிவிட்டது. துருவேயால் ஒன்றும் செய்ய முடியவில்லை. லக்னோ-மும்பை
ரயில் வந்தது. 

அதில் இருந்து இறங்கிய
பயணிகள் எல்லாம் விஷ வாயுவைத் தாங்க முடியாமல் சுருண்டு விழுந்தார்கள்.
ஓடியவர்கள் இன்னும் சீக்கிரம்
இறந்தார்கள்.

கொஞ்ச நேரத்தில் போபால் ரயில்
நிலையத்தில் 191 பிணங்கள் கிடந்தன. அந்தக்
காட்சி துருவேயை நிலை குலைய வைத்தது. 

பதற்றத்தோடு சிக்னல் அறைக்கு ஓடினார். அங்கு அவருக்குக்
கீழ் பணிபுரியும் சிக்னல் மேன் வாயில் ரத்தம் வழிய செத்துக் கிடந்தார். அவரை
ஓரமாக நகர்த்திப்போட்டுவிட்டு, எந்த ரயிலும்
போபால் வழியே வந்துவிட வேண்டாம்' என்று
தகவல் அனுப்பத் தொடங்கினார்.

அதையும் மீறி வரும் ரயில்கள் ஜன்னலை மூடிக் கொண்டு போபால் ஸ்டேஷனில் நிற்காமல் வேகமாகப் போய் விடுமாறு
அறிவுறுத்தினார்.

மூக்கிலும் வாயிலும் வழிந்த ரத்தத்தைத் துடைத்துக் கொண்டு, இரவு முழுவதும்
விழித்திருந்து வேலை பார்த்தார். அந்த இரவு விடிந்தது. 

அடுத்த நாள் சிக்னல் அறையைத்
திறந்தபோது, ஸ்டேஷன் மாஸ்டர் துருவே வாயில்
ரத்தம் வழிந்த நிலையில் சிக்னல் அனுப்பும் கருவியை ஒரு கையால் பிடித்தபடி செத்துக் கிடந்தார்.

துருவே மட்டும் இல்லை எனில், போபால் விஷ வாயுக் கசிவின் மரண எண்ணிக்கை இன்னும்
சில ஆயிரங்கள் கூடியிருக்கும். 

ஆனால்,
போபால் நகரத்தில் விஷவாயு கசிந்த அந்த இரவில் மாநில முதல்வர் அர்ஜுன் சிங்,
நகரில் இருந்து 14 கி.மீ ஓடோடிச் சென்று தப்பித்தார்.

’துருவே’ போன்ற தேச வீரர்களின் தியாகம் ஏனோ அங்கீகரிக்கப் படுவதும் இல்லை.

மக்களுக்கு ஞாபகம் இருப்பதும
் இல்லை.

பகிரவாவது செய்வோம்.

ஜெய்ஹிந்த்.

15/03/16, 10:21 PM - Pornima Akka: Read this interesting piece, at your leisure....

Very interesting and worth reading story titled The Stranger. It will open your eyes to the reality of this generation. 


A few years after I was born, my Dad met a stranger who was new to our small town. It was 1983. 

From the beginning, Dad was fascinated with this enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with our family. The stranger was quickly accepted and was around from then on.

As I grew up, I never questioned his place in my family. In my young mind, he had a special niche.

My parents were complementary instructors: 
Mom taught me good from evil, and 
Dad taught me to obey.

But the stranger... 
He was d storyteller. He would keep us spellbound for hours on end with adventures, mysteries and comedies.

If I wanted to know anything about politics, history or science, he always knew the answers about the past, understood the present and even seemed able to predict the future! 

He took my family to the first cricket tournament. He made me laugh, and he made me cry. The stranger never stopped talking, but Dad didn't seem to mind.

Sometimes, Mom would get up quietly while the rest of us were shushing each other to listen to what he had to say, and she would go to the kitchen for peace and quiet.

(I wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger to leave.)

Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions, but the stranger never felt obligated to honor them.

Obscenity, for example, was not allowed in our home - not from us, our friends or any visitors. Our long time visitor, however, got away with four-letter words that burned my ears and made my dad squirm and my mother blush.

My Dad didn't permit the liberal use of alcohol but the stranger encouraged us to try it on a regular basis. 

He made cigarettes look cool, cigars manly, and pipes distinguished.

He talked freely (much too freely!) about lewd things. His comments were sometimes blatant, sometimes suggestive, and generally embarrassing..

I now know that my early concepts about relationships were influenced strongly by the stranger. 

Time after time, he opposed the values of my parents, yet he was seldom rebuked... And NEVER asked to leave.

More than 30 years have passed since the stranger moved in with our family. He has blended right in and is not nearly as fascinating as he was at first. Still, if you could walk into my den today, you would still find him sitting over in his corner, waiting for someone to listen to him talk and watch him draw his pictures.

His name?....


We just call him 'TV.'😁😁😁

He got married a decade ago. His wife......we call her 'Computer.'😂😂😂

Their first child is 'Smart Phone' born in 2008 and the second child "iPod " born 2010
😂😂😂


And just last year they had a grandchild the iPad. 😂😂😂


 The great grand child is expected soon this year end ................

After the war with Ravana and Rama, 

Hanumanji submitted his Travel Allowance Bill for his official tour for collecting Sanjeevani Booti to Ayodhya administration. 

The Auditor in Bill Section raised 3 objections : 

(1) Hanumanji did not take prior permission of the appropriate authority (Bharat), the King of Ayodhya, during the relevant time for his travel

(2) Hanumanji being Grade 2-officer was not entitled to air travel; 

(3) Hanumanji was asked to bring Sanjeevani Booti, just a single plant, but he carried a whole mountain (unauthorized excess baggage). 

The Auditor returned the bill. King Ram could do nothing except mark it down for re-examination. 

A worried Hanumanji approached the Auditor and offered a bribe of 20% of the T.A.Bill amount.

The Auditor now wrote on the Bill : 

Re-examined : 
1. Even during the relevant time, Ram was still the king through his Paduka.

2. Further in an emergency, non-entitled officers can be authorized ex-post facto to fly.

3. Also excess baggage is justified as bringing a wrong plant would have entailed multiple journeys with extra cost; hence bill may be paid.

Ram ji shocked !!😳
That's Accounts department 
😂😂😂😂😝😝 
 Wish u a happy financial year ending

21/03/16, 11:05 AM - Vidya Perima: Dear all, 
Due to the Equinox phenomenon that will affect in the next 5days. Pls stay indoors especially from 12pm-3pm daily. The temperature will fluctuate till 40 degrees Celsius. This can easily cause dehydration and sun stroke. (Ps: this phenomena is due to the sun directly positioned above the equator line. )
Please keep everyone inclusive of yourself hydrated. Everyone should be consuming about 3 litres of fluid everyday. Monitor everyone's blood pressure as frequent as possible. Many may get heat stroke.
Cold showers as frequent as possible. Reduce meat increase fruits & veg.

Heat wave is no joke! Place a new unused candle outside home area or exposed area. If candle can melt, its in dangerous level.
Always place a pail or 2 water half filled in living room & each in every room to keep moist temperature down.
Heat stroke has no indicative symptoms. Once fainted, its seriously dangerous as organ failure kicks in.
Always check lips, eye balls moisture.

TRUE INCIDENT by Ranjani - Useful for people traveling in Chennai buses!!

" I m working in Chennai One(Thoraipakkam), Chennai. I usually travelby
Metropolitan Transport Corporation(MTC) bus, from jain college stop (Which
is near to my office) to tidel park and from Tidel park I will catch train,
to home. MTC bus coming from kelambakkam(19B,21H) mostly wont stop in tidel
park in early days. So I usually prefer to get into T51 bus, which will
stop in tidel park stop. After some time 19B started stopping in tidel park
also.

Today while returning from office at around 8.30 pm, I was in a hurry to
catch my 9.28 pm train at Tidel park. I got up a bus(19B) in Jain College
at around 8.45 pm, and asked the conductor to give a ticket for tidel park
stop. He said, the bus wont stop there, and he asked me to get down at
signal if it stops there or else get down at stop next to tidel park. I was
argugingwith him that I am going daily with the same bus and get down in
the tidel park stop. But he kept on saying the same thing.. I got
irritated with conductor response. Suddenly I remembered a complaint phone
no.(9884301013) I read in one bus sometime back and noted down in my
mobile. I called that no. and said about the incident that conductor is not
stopping in the usual stop.

The MTC representative (person at the other end) asked me to give the phone
to the conductor. The conductor was not interested to talking with his
official. The MTC rep. asked me the bus registration no. He enquired where
is the bus at that time and I said it is in Kandhanchavadi. The MTC rep.
said he will come in the line and talk to them. I was curious how he will
come and catch the bus.

After few mins. the wireless transmeter(to track the bus), near the driver
in the bus started shouting... Driver stop the bus. Driver stop the bus in
the left side of the road. Driver was not sure what is happening may be his
first experience, for others(including me) it is the real first
experience. The driver stopped the bus and started listening to the
transmeter. The MTC rep. enquired why the bus is not stopping in tidel park
stop. The driver said he stops in tidel park stop and in the previous trip
also he has done. The rep. asked him then why the conductor is saying like
that. He asked the conductor what is the issue. The conductor was
speechless. The driver somehow managed the situation and supported the
conductor by saying that the conductor was new to this route. The driver
asked excuse for the incident and said he will stop in the Tidel Park stop

The MTC rep. said he wanted to talk the passenger who called him. I went
near the transmeter and spoke to the MTC rep. He said sorry for the
incident happened and asked sorry on behalf of MTC. Everyone in the bus
were surprised of things happening. I came back to my seat and I was so
embarrassed as all were looking at me. Few passengers asked me what is the
number, and whom I called. They also took the number. The bus stopped in Tidel Park
stop then. After getting down I called the MTC rep. and said the bus
stopped in the stopping.

It was a nice experience for me and others who traveled in the bus,
including driver and conductor and I was very surprised after this incident.
Yes, nowadays good things are happening in government sector also and
technology is used properly."

27/03/16, 10:24 AM - natarajan ramu: Mind Blowing Facts about Sanskrit
-------------------------------------
• Sanskrit has the highest number of vocabularies than any other language in the world.

• 102 arab 78 crore 50 lakh words have been used till now in Sanskrit. If it will be used in computers & technology, then more these number of words will be used in next 100 years.

• Sanskrit has the power to say a sentence in a minimum number of words than any other language.

• America has a University dedicated to Sanskrit and the NASA too has a department in it to research on Sanskrit manuscripts.

• Sanskrit is the best computer friendly language.(Ref: Forbes Magazine July 1987).

• Sanskrit is a highly regularized language. In fact, NASA declared it to be the “only unambiguous spoken language on the planet” – and very suitable for computer comprehension.

• Sanskrit is an official language of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

• There is a report by a NASA scientist that America is creating 6th and 7th generation super computers based on Sanskrit language. Project deadline is 2025 for 6th generation and 2034 for 7th generation computer. After this there will be a revolution all over the world to learn Sanskrit.

• The language is rich in most advanced science, contained in their books called Vedas, Upanishads, Shruti, Smriti, Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana etc. (Ref: Russian State University, NASA etc. NASA possesses 60,000 palm leaf manuscripts, which they are studying.)

• Learning of Sanskrit improves brain functioning. Students start getting better marks in other subjects like Mathematics, Science etc., which some people find difficult. It enhances the memory power. James Junior School, London, has made Sanskrit compulsory. Students of this school are among the toppers year after year. This has been followed by some schools in Ireland also.

• Research has shown that the phonetics of this language has roots in various energy points of the body and reading, speaking or reciting Sanskrit stimulates these points and raises the energy levels, whereby resistance against illnesses, relaxation to mind and reduction of stress are achieved.

• Sanskrit is the only language, which uses all the nerves of the tongue. By its pronunciation, energy points in the body are activated that causes the blood circulation to improve. This, coupled with the enhanced brain functioning and higher energy levels, ensures better health. Blood Pressure, diabetes, cholesterol etc. are controlled. (Ref: American Hindu University after constant study)

• There are reports that Russians, Germans and Americans are actively doing research on Hindu’s sacred books and are producing them back to the world in their name. Seventeen countries around the world have a University or two to study Sanskrit to gain technological advantages.

• Surprisingly, it is not just a language. Sanskrit is the primordial conduit between Human Thought and the Soul; Physics and Metaphysics; Subtle and Gross; Culture and Art; Nature and its Author; Created and the Creator.

• Sanskrit is the scholarly language of 3 major World religions – Hinduism, Buddhism (along with Pali) and Jainism (second to Prakrit). 

• Today, there are a handful of Indian villages (in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) where Sanskrit is still spoken as the main language. For example in the village of Mathur in Karnataka, more than 90% of the population knows Sanskrit. Mathur/Mattur is a village 10 kms from Shimoga speaks Sanskrit on daily basis (day-to-day communication).

• Even a Sanskrit daily newspaper exists! Sudharma, published out of Mysore, has been running since 1970 and is now available online as an e-paper (sudharma.epapertoday.com)!

• The best type of calendar being used is hindu calendar(as the new year starts with the geological change of the solar system)
ref: german state university

• The UK is presently researching on a defence system based on Hindu’s shri chakra.

• Another interesting fact about Sanskrit language was that the process of introducing new words into the language continued for a long period until it was stopped by the great grammarian Panini who wrote an entire grammar for the language laying down rules for the derivation of each and every word in Sanskrit and disallowed the introducing of new words by giving a full list of Roots and Nouns. Even after Panini, some changes occur which were regularised by Vararuchi and finally by Patanjali. Any infringement of the rules as laid down by Patanjali was regarded as a grammatical error and hence the Sanskrit Language has remained in same without any change from the date of Patanjali (about 250 B.C.) up to this day.

• संस्कृत is the only language in the world that exists since millions of years. Millions of languages that emerged from Sanskrit are dead and millions will come but Sanskrit will remain eternal. It is truly language of Bhagwan. Wealth of information on Sanskrit language. 👌👌👌 👆👆👆 Shows how India lags behind the Americans in this matter. We Indians are reading sacred texts, performing pujas for various religious festivals throughout the year. So we will not be lying if we say Sanskrit as also one of the languages in the next Census excercise without forgetting, thus help save our own language from disappearing & doing our bit for the language. Please forward this to  maximum Whatsapp mobile numbers & groups.
27/03/16, 10:24 AM - natarajan ramu: Science behind Gotra : (Genetics)
What is Gotra system ?
Why do we have this ? Why do we consider this to decide marriages ?
Why should sons carry the gotra of father, why not daughter ?
How does gotra of a daughter changes after she gets married ?
What is the logic ?
Infact this is an amazing genetic science we follow.
Let's see the science of genetics behind gotra systems.
The word GOTRA formed from two sanskrit words GAU (means cow) and Trahi (means shed).
Gotra means cowshed.
Gotra is like cowshed protecting a particular male lineage. We identify our male lineage / gotra by considering to be descendants of the 8 great rishi (sapta rishi + bharadwaj rishi). All the other gotra evolved from these only.
Let's see why human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes (one from father and one from mother) on these 23 pairs, there is one pair called sex chromosomes which decides the gender of person.
During conception if the resultant cell is XX chromosomes then the child will be girl, if it is XY then it is boy.
In XY - X is from mother and Y is from father.
In this Y is unique and it doesn't mix. So in XY, Y will supress the X and son will get Y chromosomes. Y is the only chromosome which gets passed down only between male lineage. (Father to Son and to Grandson).
Women never gets Y. Hence Y plays a crucial role in genetics in identifying the genealogy. Since women never get Y the gotra of a women is said to be of her husband.
They are 8 diff Y chromosomes from 8 rishis. If we are from Same gotra then it means we are from same root ancestor.
Marriages between same gotra will increase the risk of causing genetic disorders as same gotra Y chromosomes cannot have crossover and it will activate the defective cells.
If this continues, it will reduce the size and strength of Y chromosome which is crucial for the creation of male.
If no Y chromosome is present in this world, then it will cause males to become extinct.
So Gotra system is a method to avoid genetic disorders and attempt to protect Y chromosome.

Amazing bio-science by our Maharishis. Our Heritage is unarguably THE GREATEST.

A devout Arab Muslim got into a  cab in London. He curtly asked the cabbie to turn off the radio because as decreed by his religious teaching, he must not listen to music because in the time of the prophet there was no music, especially Western music, which is the music of the infidel.

The cab driver politely switched off the radio, stopped the cab and opened the door. The Arab Muslim asked him, "What are you doing????

The cabbie answered, "In the time of the prophet there were no taxis, no bombs, no plane hijacks, no west invented  loud speakers in mosques that woke up newly born , elderly n d sick at unearthly hours , no suicide attacks, no RDX, no AK 56, only ''peace'' everywhere. So shut up and wait for a camel."

Arnab: What do you feed your goats with?
Farmer: Which one? The white one or the black one?
Arnab: The white one. 
Farmer: Grass. 
Arnab: And the black one? 
Farmer: Also grass.

Arnab: Where do you tie up your goats?
Farmer: Which one? The white one or the black one? 
Arnab: The white one. 
Farmer: Inside the barn.
Arnab: And the black one?
Farmer: That one too inside the barn.

Arnab: With what do you wash your goats? 
Farmer: The white one or the black one? 
Arnab: The white one. 
Farmer: With water. 
Arnab: And the black one? 
Farmer: That one also with water. 

Arnab goswami gets angry and yells India wants to know, you bloody fellow...that If you do the same thing for both the goats, why are you repeatedly asking me white or black.. ?

Farmer: Because the white goat is mine.
Arnab: And the black goat?
Farmer: That is also mine.

Arnab goswami faints... 

After he regains his consciousness,  the farmer explains... Now you know how we feel when your tv channel shows the same news by twisting and turning it... ?

04/04/16, 9:03 AM - natarajan ramu: Medical - Second Opinion

BEWARE OF CORPORATE HOSPITALS AND CORPORATE DOCTORS.

Corporate hospitals are paying a salary of one and half lakh per month to their doctors. But they have monthly targets. the target  condition for them to remain in job  is that, they have to write tests and and scans worth 3 lakhs and trap 25 patients for surgery every month. This is  not happening in charity hospitals. In many hospitals, unwanted surgeries and risky premature cataract surgeries are being carried out. One has to be fearful of corporate hospitals. If you show your medical card or if you say " Doctor, don't bother about expense, please save the life " to a corporate doctor, you are gone. If they terrify you and do not give time to think, you should become alert. A genuine doctor will talk encouragingly and don't terrify you. You can ask your family doctor or a friendly doctor to visit the patient as a visitor and take a second opinion before plunge into corporate hands

 If you or your family have been advised a surgery or a medical procedure and if you are confused about the medical options for you, then call at 70266 46022 or send your medical reports at medical@medisense.me or visit medisensehealth.com. They will get you a second opinion from an expert doctors panel. It is a free service for patients.

This free service for patients is available in 21 cities in India which includes UDUPI, mangalore, Bangalore, mumbai, chennai, Hyd etc. Pls pass on to all your loved ones.

04/04/16, 10:01 PM - Harish Kumaraswami: I was jogging this morning and I noticed a person about 1/2 a kilometre ahead. I could tell he was running a little slower than me and I thought, good, I shall try to catch him. I had about a kilometre before I needed to turn off. So I started running faster and faster.

Every block, I was gaining on him just a little bit. After just a few minutes I was only about 100 metres behind him, so I really picked up the pace and pushed myself. You would have thought I was running in the last leg of an Olympic competition. I was determined to catch him.

Finally, I did it! I caught and passed him. On the inside, I felt so good. "I beat him" Of course, he didn't even know we were racing. After I passed him, I realized I had been so focused on competing against him that I had missed my turn. I had gone nearly six blocks past my turn and I had to turn and go back.

Isn't that what happens in life when we focus on competing with co-workers, neighbors, friends, family, trying to outdo them or trying to prove that we are more successful or more important?

We spend our time and energy running after them and we miss out on our own paths to our given destinies. The problem with unhealthy competition is that it's a never ending cycle.

There will always be somebody ahead of you, someone with a better job, nicer car, more money in the bank, more education, a prettier wife, a more handsome husband, better behaved children, etc. But realize that "You can be the best that you can be, when you are not competing with anyone."

Some people are insecure because they pay too much attention to what others are, where others are going, wearing and driving. Take whatever you have, the height, weight and personality. Dress well and wear it proudly, you'll be blessed by it. Stay focused and live a healthy life. There is no competition in Destiny.

Run your own race and wish others well.

05/04/16, 8:41 AM - natarajan ramu: வாழ்வில் ஒருமுறையாவது சென்று
 தரிசிக்க வேண்டிய சிவ ஸ்தலம்..!

உலக சிறப்புமிக்க இந்த சிவனாலயம்
குஜராத்தின் பாவ் நகரின் அருகில் உள்ள கடற்கரை கோலியாக். இங்கு கடலுக்குள் உள்ளது உலகச் சிறப்பு மிக்க இந்த  நிஷ்களங்கேஷ்வர் சிவன் ஆலயம். இந்த ஆலயம் கடற்கரையில் இருந்து சுமார் ஒரு கிலோமீட்டர் தொலைவில் அமைந்துள்ளது.

தினந்தோறும் பகல் ஒரு மணிமுதல் இரவு பத்து மணி வரை கடல் உள்வாங்கி கடலினுள் உள்ள சிவனை வழிபட வழி ஏற்படுத்தி கொடுக்கிறது. பாண்டவர்கள் வழிபட்டதன் நினைவாக... இந்த ஆலயத்தில் ஐந்து சிவலிங்கங்கள் அமைந்துள்ளன.

இந்த ஆலயத்தின் கல் கொடிமர் (சுமார் இருபது முதல் முப்பதடி உயரம் உடையது) இதுவரை வீசிய புயல்களினால் சேதமடை யாமல் உள்ளது. தினமும் பகல் ஒரு மணிவரை கடல் நீர் மட்டம் இந்த கொடி மரத்தின் உச்சியைத் தொடும்.

பின் மெல்ல மெல்ல கடலின் நீர் மட்டம் குறைய ஆரம்பித்து இருபுறமும் கடல் விலகி சிவனை வணங்க வழி ஏற்படுத்தி கொடுக்கிறது. நீர் மட்டம் குறைய குறைய மக்கள் மெதுவாக கடலினுள் சென்று சிவனை வணங்கி விட்டு மீண்டும் கரைநோக்கித் திரும்புவது இக்கோவிலின் தனிச்சிறப்பு.

05/04/16, 10:19 AM - natarajan ramu: முக்கியத் தகவல்:
பிளாஸ்டிக் பாட்டில்களின் அடியில் முக்கோண வடிவமிட்டு அதன் உள்ளே ஒரு எண் இருக்கும். ("Resin identification code" - 1 முதல் 7 வரை). இந்த எண் அந்த பிளாஸ்டிக்கின் தரம், அதில் பயன்படுத்தப்பட்ட பாலிமர்(Type of polymer) தரத்தை குறிக்கும்.
நீங்கள் தண்ணீர் கொண்டு செல்லும் பிளாஸ்டிக் பாட்டிலின் கீழே உள்ள எண் 5 முதல் 7 வரை (Food grade plastics) இருந்தால் நிச்சயம் உங்கள் நீரும், அதை குடிக்கும் உங்கள் ஆரோக்கியமும் பாதுகாப்பாக உள்ளது. 
காரணம் 1- 4 வரை எண் உள்ள பாட்டில்கள் உணவு எடுத்து செல்லும் தகுதி உடையவை அல்ல. 5 - 7 வரை உள்ளவை மட்டுமே உணவு கொண்டு செல்லும் தரம் உடையவை.
உணவு பொருட்கள் கொண்டு செல்லும் பிளாஸ்டிக்குகள் (தண்ணீர், உணவு, பழம், காய்கறிகள் எதுவாக இருந்தாலும் சரி) எப்போதும் 5 - 7 வரை எண் கொண்ட பிளாஸ்டிக்கா என பார்த்து வாங்குங்கள்(Food Grade Plastic).
1 - 4 எண் கொண்டவை உணவு கொண்டு செல்ல தகுதியானவை அல்ல. அவை வெப்ப சூழல் மாறும் போது கார்சினோஜென் (Carcinogens) எனப்படும் ஒன்றை வெளியிடுவதால் அதில் உள்ள உணவை உண்பவருக்கு புற்றுநோய் (Cancer) ஏற்பட காரணமாகிறது.பிளாஸ்டிக்கில் கவனம் தேவை !!!
06/04/16, 7:20 AM - Paiya perrippa: A Little boy went to a telephone booth which   was at the cash counter of a store and dialed a number. The store-owner observed and listened to the conversation:

Boy: “Madam, can you give me the job of cutting your lawn?”

Woman: (at the other end of the phone line) “I already have someone to cut my lawn.”

Boy: “Madam, I will cut your lawn for half the price than the person who cuts your lawn now.”

Woman: “I’m very satisfied with the person who is presently cutting the lawn.”

Boy: (with more perseverance) “Madam, I’ll even sweep the floor and the stairs of your house for free.”

Woman: “No, thank you.”

With a smile on his face, the little boy put the receiver down. The store-owner, who was listening to all this, walked over to the boy.

Store-owner: “Son….I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and would like to offer you a job.”

Boy: “No thanks.”

Store-owner: “But you were really pleading for one.”

Boy: “No Sir, I was just checking my performance at the job I already have. I am the one who is working for that lady I was talking
 to!”

This is called "Self-Appraisal”

Give your best and the world comes to you!

06/04/16, 5:05 PM - natarajan ramu: Couldn't resist sharing this beautiful story 😊 

This story is about a beautiful, expensively dressed lady who complained to her Psychiatrist that she felt that her whole life was empty, it had no meaning.

So, the lady went to visit a Counsellor to seek out happiness.

The Counsellor called the old lady who cleaned the Office floors.

The Counsellor then said to the rich lady ... see "I'm going to ask Mary here to tell u how she found happiness. All I want u to do is just "listen to her."

So, the old lady put down her broom and sat on a chair and told her story:

"Well, my husband died of malaria and three months later my only son was killed in a car accident. 
I had nobody. 
I had nothing left. 
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.
I never smiled at anyone. I even thought of taking my own life. 

Then, all of a sudden, one evening, a little kitten followed me home from work. Somehow I felt sorry for that kitten. It was cold outside. So, I decided to let the kitten in. I got some milk, and the kitten licked the plate clean. Then, it purred and rubbed against my leg and, for the first time in months, I smiled.

Then, I stopped to think negatively. If helping a little kitten could make me smile, may be doing something for needy people could definitely make me happy.

So, the next day, I baked some Biscuits and took them to a neighbour who was sick in bed.

Everyday,  I tried to do something nice for someone. It made me so happy to see them happy.

Today, I don't know of anybody who sleeps and eats better than I do.

I've found happiness, by giving it to others."
 
When the rich lady heard this, she cried. She had everything that money could buy, but she had lost the things which money cannot buy.

"The beauty of life does not depend on how happy you are; but on how happy others can be because of you..."
 
Happiness is not a destination, it's a journey. 
Happiness is not tomorrow, it is now. 

Happiness is not dependency, it is a decision.
 
Happiness is what you are, and not what you have..😊  

Be happy and make others happy too...✌👍🙌😊

காமராஜரோ ஒன்றும் இல்லை , சும்மா தான் போட்டுள்ளேன் என்று சொல்லி இருக்கிறார்.

பத்திரிகையாளர்களோ அவரை விடவில்லை. துண்டு மாற்றி போட்டதற்கு காரணம் என்ன? என்று துளைக்க ஆரம்பித்துள்ளனர்.

 உடனே காமராஜர் ஒண்ணும் இல்லையா , "இடது பக்கம் சட்டை கிழிந்துள்ளது அதை மறைக்கத்தான் இடது பக்கம் துண்டை போட்டுள்ளேன்" என்றாராம் ,

 வேணும்ன்னா பாருங்கள் என்று துண்டை எடுத்து கிழிந்த சட்டையை காண்பித்தாராம். Pin drop silence....

அதைக்கண்ட பத்திரிக்கையாளர்கள் அனைவரும் தலைகவிழ்ந்தனர்.

12/04/16, 5:20 PM - Pornima Akka: The headrest of car seats is deliberately kept detachable and sharp so that it could be used to break open the glass of car in case of fire and emergency. The car's glass too are kept easily breakable from inside. Very few people know about it and thus can't save themselves in case of emergencies.
Please share it with as many possible and educate.

18/04/16, 7:31 AM - Paiya perrippa: One night Sri Adi Shankaracharya, 
the great Advaita master, was desperately searching for something on the street outside his small hut. When his pupil returned from his errand, he saw this and curiously asked the Master, “Aacharya, what are you looking for here on the street at this hour?”

Shankaracharya  replied, “I lost my needle, I am looking for it.”

The pupil joined him in the search, but after searching for a while, he asked, “Can you try and recollect where you might have dropped it?”

Shankaracharya  said, “Of course, I remember. I dropped it near the bed in the hut.”

The pupil, utterly astonished at the strange answer, said,  “Aacharya, you say you lost it inside the house, then why are we looking for it outside?”

Shankaracharya  innocently replied, “There is no oil left in the lamp, so it is pitch dark inside the house. Hence I thought of searching for it outside, since there is enough street light here.”

While holding back his laugh, the pupil said, “If you lost your needle inside the house, how could you even expect to find it outside?”

Shankaracharya simply smiled back at the pupil and the pupil got the message behind the acharya's puzzling act. 

Isint that what we do? We run to far away temples and walk up mountains to search for what we have lost inside ourselves. We are all seeking outside what we have lost inside us. Why? Just because it is pitch dark Inside. 
Silly, aren’t we?!

Light the lamp inside you and find your lost treasure right therein.🙏🌺

18/04/16, 10:30 AM - natarajan ramu: 🛫படித்ததில் பிடித்தது🛬

நான் அந்த விமானத்தில் ஏறி என் இருக்கையைத்  தேடி அமர்ந்தேன்.. 
விமானம் புறப்படும் சற்று நிமிடம் முன்பு ஒரு பதினைந்து இராணுவ வீரர்கள் வந்து என் இருக்கையை சுற்றி அமர்ந்தார்கள்..  நான் அவர்களுடன் பேச்சுக்கொடுக்க ஆரம்பித்தேன்..

எந்த எல்லைக்கு பணி நிமித்தமாக செல்கிறீர்கள்..?
ஆக்ராவுக்கு ..அங்கு இரண்டு வாரம் பயிற்சி, அதன் பின்பு எல்லையில் பாதுகாப்பு பணி ...

ஒரு மணி நேரம் சென்றிருக்கும்.. அப்பொழுது ஒரு அறிவிப்பு.. மதிய உணவு தயார்.. 
சரி உணவு வாங்கலாம் என்று நான் என் பர்ஸை எடுக்க...பின்னால் ராணுவ வீரர்களின் பேச்சை கேட்டேன்.. 
நீ சாப்பாடு வாங்கலையா?
இல்லை ..விலை அதிகம்..என்னால் அவ்வளவு காசு செலவழிக்க முடியாது.. மூன்று மணி நேரம் போனால் டெல்லி..அங்கு இறங்கி உண்ணலாம் ..விலை குறைவு..
ஆமாம்..உண்மை..

இதை கேட்ட பொழுது.... மனம் வலித்தது..
விமானத்தின் பின்புறம் உணவுடன் நின்றிருந்த அந்த விமான பணிப்பெண்ணிடம் சென்று, பதினைந்து உணவுக்கான காசை கொடுத்து, அவர்களுக்கு உணவு கொடுக்க சொன்னேன்.. 
அந்த பணிப்பெண் என் கைகளை பிடித்தாள்.. கண்களில் கண்ணீர்.. இது கார்க்கிலில் இருக்கும் என் சகோதரனுக்கும் சேர்த்து என்றாள்.. 

நான் உண்டு முடித்து, கை கழவ சென்றேன்.. அப்பொழுது ஒரு முதியவர் என்னை நிறுத்தி, நீங்கள் செய்தததை நான் பார்த்தேன்.. இந்தாருங்கள்..என் பங்கு ரூபாய் 500 என்று என்னிடம் கொடுத்தார்.. 
நான் என் இருக்கைக்கு திரும்பினேன்..

சற்று நேரத்தில் விமான கேப்டன் என்னிடம் வந்து , என் கைகளை பிடித்து குலுக்கி, நான் முன்பு ஏர் போர்ஸ் பைலட்டாக இருந்தேன்..ஒரு நாள் எனக்கும் ஒருவர் உணவு வாங்கி கொடுத்தார். இது ஒரு கருணை செயல்..
மிக்க சந்தோஷம்.. உங்களை போன்றவர்களை தாங்கி இந்த விமானம் பயணிப்பது..என்று சொல்லி சென்றார்.
ஒரே கைதட்டல் விமானத்துக்குள் விண்ணுக்கு எட்டும் வரை..

முன்னால் இருந்த ஒரு 18 வயது இளைஞன் என்னிடம் கை குலுக்கி, என் கைக்குள் ரூபாயை திணித்தான்..

விமானம் வந்து நின்றது..நான் இறங்கினேன்.. இறங்கும் பொழுது ஒருவர் என் சட்டை பையில் சில நோட்டுக்கற்றைகளை திணித்தார்...

இறங்கி நடந்தேன்.. அந்த வீரர்கள் ஒரு குழுவாக அவர்களை ஏற்றிச்செல்லும் இராணுவ வண்டிக்காக காத்திருந்தார்கள்..
அவர்கள் அருகில் சென்றேன்.. நான் செலவழித்த பணத்தை விட, இப்பொழுது என்னிடம் அதிக பணம்..
ஒரு தூண்டுதல்..பலரின் வேண்டுதலை நிறைவேற்றியது போல்..
அனைத்து பணத்தையும் அவர்களிடம் கொடுத்தேன்.. போகும் வழியில் நன்றாக சாப்படுங்கள்.. கடவுள் உங்கள் எல்லாருக்கும் துணை இருக்கட்டும்..

காரில் ஏறி அமர்ந்தேன்.. ஒரு ஆத்ம திருப்தி..

இவர்கள் எல்லைகளை பாதுகாத்துக்கொண்டு.. உயிரினை துச்சமாக மதித்து எப்படி நம்மை காக்கிறார்கள்.. இவர்களுக்கு நான் கொடுத்தது ஒன்றுமில்லை...இதை புரியாத ஒரு பெரும் கூட்டம் இன்னமும் வாழ்ந்து கொண்டுதான் இருக்கிறது. 

வெறும் பொழுது போக்கு அம்சங்களை தரும் சினிமா   நடிகர் நடிகைகளை மிகவும் போற்றி கொண்டாடி, கோடி கணக்கில் பணம் சொத்து சம்பாதிக்கச் செய்யும் சமூகம், ஓட்டு போட்ட மக்களை  ஏமாற்றும் அரசியல்வாதிகள் மற்றும் லஞ்சம் வாங்கும்  அதிகாரிகளை கோடி கணக்கில் பணம் சொத்து சம்பாதிக்கச் செய்யும் சமூகம், இந்த இராணுவ வீரர்களை  நினைத்துக்கூட  பார்ப்பதில்லை என்ற வேதனை என்னை தாக்கியது....

18/04/16, 1:39 PM - natarajan ramu: Science behind Gotra : (Genetics)
What is Gotra system ?
Why do we have this ? Why do we consider this to decide marriages ?
Why should sons carry the gotra of father, why not daughter ?
How does gotra of a daughter changes after she gets married ?
What is the logic ?
Infact this is an amazing genetic science we follow.
Let's see the science of genetics behind gotra systems.
The word GOTRA formed from two sanskrit words GAU (means cow) and Trahi (means shed).
Gotra means cowshed.
Gotra is like cowshed protecting a particular male lineage. We identify our male lineage / gotra by considering to be descendants of the 8 great rishi (sapta rishi + bharadwaj rishi). All the other gotra evolved from these only.
Let's see why human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes (one from father and one from mother) on these 23 pairs, there is one pair called sex chromosomes which decides the gender of person.
During conception if the resultant cell is XX chromosomes then the child will be girl, if it is XY then it is boy.
In XY - X is from mother and Y is from father.
In this Y is unique and it doesn't mix. So in XY, Y will supress the X and son will get Y chromosomes. Y is the only chromosome which gets passed down only between male lineage. (Father to Son and to Grandson).
Women never gets Y. Hence Y plays a crucial role in genetics in identifying the genealogy. Since women never get Y the gotra of a women is said to be of her husband.
They are 8 diff Y chromosomes from 8 rishis. If we are from Same gotra then it means we are from same root ancestor.
Marriages between same gotra will increase the risk of causing genetic disorders as same gotra Y chromosomes cannot have crossover and it will activate the defective cells.
If this continues, it will reduce the size and strength of Y chromosome which is crucial for the creation of male.
If no Y chromosome is present in this world, then it will cause males to become extinct.
So Gotra system is a method to avoid genetic disorders and attempt to protect Y chromosome.

Amazing bio-science by our Maharishis. Our Heritage is unarguably THE GREATEST.

-------------------------------------
• Sanskrit has the highest number of vocabularies than any other language in the world.

• 102 arab 78 crore 50 lakh words have been used till now in Sanskrit. If it will be used in computers & technology, then more these number of words will be used in next 100 years.

• Sanskrit has the power to say a sentence in a minimum number of words than any other language.

• America has a University dedicated to Sanskrit and the NASA too has a department in it to research on Sanskrit manuscripts.

• Sanskrit is the best computer friendly language.(Ref: Forbes Magazine July 1987).

• Sanskrit is a highly regularized language. In fact, NASA declared it to be the “only unambiguous spoken language on the planet” – and very suitable for computer comprehension.

• Sanskrit is an official language of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

• There is a report by a NASA scientist that America is creating 6th and 7th generation super computers based on Sanskrit language. Project deadline is 2025 for 6th generation and 2034 for 7th generation computer. After this there will be a revolution all over the world to learn Sanskrit.

• The language is rich in most advanced science, contained in their books called Vedas, Upanishads, Shruti, Smriti, Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana etc. (Ref: Russian State University, NASA etc. NASA possesses 60,000 palm leaf manuscripts, which they are studying.)

• Learning of Sanskrit improves brain functioning. Students start getting better marks in other subjects like Mathematics, Science etc., which some people find difficult. It enhances the memory power. James Junior School, London, has made Sanskrit compulsory. Students of this school are among the toppers year after year. This has been followed by some schools in Ireland also.

• Research has shown that the phonetics of this language has roots in various energy points of the body and reading, speaking or reciting Sanskrit stimulates these points and raises the energy levels, whereby resistance against illnesses, relaxation to mind and reduction of stress are achieved.

• Sanskrit is the only language, which uses all the nerves of the tongue. By its pronunciation, energy points in the body are activated that causes the blood circulation to improve. This, coupled with the enhanced brain functioning and higher energy levels, ensures better health. Blood Pressure, diabetes, cholesterol etc. are controlled. (Ref: American Hindu University after constant study)

• There are reports that Russians, Germans and Americans are actively doing research on Hindu’s sacred books and are producing them back to the world in their name. Seventeen countries around the world have a University or two to study Sanskrit to gain technological advantages.

• Surprisingly, it is not just a language. Sanskrit is the primordial conduit between Human Thought and the Soul; Physics and Metaphysics; Subtle and Gross; Culture and Art; Nature and its Author; Created and the Creator.

• Sanskrit is the scholarly language of 3 major World religions – Hinduism, Buddhism (along with Pali) and Jainism (second to Prakrit). 

• Today, there are a handful of Indian villages (in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) where Sanskrit is still spoken as the main language. For example in the village of Mathur in Karnataka, more than 90% of the population knows Sanskrit. Mathur/Mattur is a village 10 kms from Shimoga speaks Sanskrit on daily basis (day-to-day communication).

• Even a Sanskrit daily newspaper exists! Sudharma, published out of Mysore, has been running since 1970 and is now available online as an e-paper (sudharma.epapertoday.com)!

• The best type of calendar being used is hindu calendar(as the new year starts with the geological change of the solar system)
ref: german state university

• The UK is presently researching on a defence system based on Hindu’s shri chakra.

• Another interesting fact about Sanskrit language was that the process of introducing new words into the language continued for a long period until it was stopped by the great grammarian Panini who wrote an entire grammar for the language laying down rules for the derivation of each and every word in Sanskrit and disallowed the introducing of new words by giving a full list of Roots and Nouns. Even after Panini, some changes occur which were regularised by Vararuchi and finally by Patanjali. Any infringement of the rules as laid down by Patanjali was regarded as a grammatical error and hence the Sanskrit Language has remained in same without any change from the date of Patanjali (about 250 B.C.) up to this day.

• संस्कृत is the only language in the world that exists since millions of years. Millions of languages that emerged from Sanskrit are dead and millions will come but Sanskrit will remain eternal. It is truly language of Bhagwan. Wealth of information on Sanskrit language. 👌👌👌 👆👆👆 Shows how India lags behind the Americans in this matter. We Indians are reading sacred texts, performing pujas for various religious festivals throughout the year. So we will not be lying if we say Sanskrit as also one of the languages in the next Census excercise without forgetting, thus help save our own language from disappearing & doing our bit for the language.

27/04/16, 4:48 PM - natarajan ramu: Dr.Subramanian Swamy: From Mathematical Economist to Public Interest leader par excellence.
By R.Vaidyanathan

Dr. Swamy's entry into Rajya Sabha will strike fear in the hearts of his opponents

Every time I talk or write about Dr.Swamy, I find that there are so many areas that have not been covered. He has been a Teacher, an Economist, a Mathematician, a Politician, Rebel, Crusader against Black Money, appreciated by the Chinese/ Israelis and US leaders, Dog lover and looked at with awe and worry by his opponents. He is the closest in definition to what an Ashtavadhani would do.

…that India can grow at 10%. In those days, it was considered radical. It just goes to show really how far-sighted he was…

When I joined Indian Statistical Institute [ISI] in the early seventies and came to know that Dr.Swamy was an Alumnus, my interest in him started. After his studies at The Hindu College where he stood 3rd in the university, he joined the ISI for a Masters. I came to know that he was not afraid to criticise P.C.Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI–about one of his papers.

It should be remembered that Mahalanobis was the brain behind setting up of the Planning Commission, something that Prime Minister Narendra Modi after many decades in 2014 dismantled.

He was the kind of person that no one –not a student under him- dared to question his research etc. But Dr.Swamy was very good at crunching numbers and developing theories.

Dr.Swamy’s famous paper ‘Notes on Fractile Graphical Analysis’ published in Econometrica, 1963 had questioned a Mahalanobis statistical analysis method as not being original but only a differentiated form of an older equation. That really pitched him as a giant killer in those early days.

Hendrik S Houthakker the American economist who was the referee for the paper published in Econometrica recommended Swamy’s admission to Harvard. He got Rockefeller’s scholarship and completed his Ph.D. in 2 and half years when he was just 24. That was really a record. By 27, he was teaching at Harvard !

He co-authored a paper in 1974 on the theory of Index numbers with Dr.Samuelson—the first American to get Nobel award in Economics- and it was a pioneering effort.

He then in 1975, wrote a book titled “Economic Growth in China and India, 1952–70: A Comparative Appraisal” which is considered as the most authoritative work on the subject. When someone challenged him to learn Mandarin – a tough language in one year, he learnt it in 3 months! 
Till this day, Swamy is considered an authority on the Chinese Economy.

He met his future wife a Parsi woman – Roxna – at Harvard where she was doing her mathematics research. Later she studied law to practice in Supreme Court of India.

Then he was invited by Delhi School of Economics – by Prof.Amartya Sen – to join Chinese studies as a Chair Professor. But when the powers that be at DSE learnt about his free market thinking and views on nuclear energy— and changed their mind. Upon landing in India, he found out that they offered him a Readers’ job when he was already a Professor at Harvard. Feeling slighted, he rejected the offer.

He then joined IIT Delhi in 1969 from where he was expelled in 1972 by the then government for his anti-communist views. He wanted five-year plans to be scrapped and argued in the seventies that India can grow at 10%. In those days, it was considered radical. It just goes to show really how far-sighted he was since today everyone is talking about it.

In 1970, Indira Gandhi “dismissed” his economic views as that of a “Santa Claus with unrealistic ideas”. The same views were to be implemented by Dr.Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister in 1992 under PVN Rao as PM. That  is the irony of our politics and shows he was far ahead of his time.

After his expulsion from IIT Delhi, he fought a court case and got re-instated in 1991. He joined for a day just to prove his point before resigning.

He was invited by Nanaji Deshmukh the doyen of Indian politics to join Rajya Sabha in 1974. That changed his professorial life to that of a political leader.

When Emergency was declared in 1975 he went underground –travelled extensively in the USA to expose emergency. He made a dramatic appearance in Parliament—10th August 1976- to “condole the demise of democracy” and wanted an obituary reference on the same. He immediately left the Parliament and disappeared into thin air. That electrified the entire opposition to Emergency for the “audacity” and Dare Devilry against Indira Gandhi.

Post emergency he was one of the founder members of Janata Party and he continued with the party till the party merged with BJP in 2013. From that angle, he was never a party hopper.

He also had the unique distinction of being a cabinet rank member in P.V.Narasimha Rao cabinet even though he did not belong to Congress. He was appointed by the then Prime Minister in 1994 as Chairman with Commission on Labour Standards and International Trade with a cabinet rank.

The other aspects about him pertaining to exposure of 2G scam or protection of Sethu Samudram project and National Herald case are recent and well known.

Not many know that he was instrumental in removing the so-called “Single directive” by which permission from  Government was needed before CBI proceeds against any official.

Swamy took this to the Supreme Court which struck down this clause giving investigating agencies freedom to act against possible culprits.

He was solely responsible for the opening up of Manasarovar route to Indians after his meeting with Deng Xiaoping in 1981.

It is an interesting journey of the Mathematician/ Economist as a public interest political leader, a person whose home Goddess Saraswati has taken residence.

His current journey as Rajya Sabha member will create tremors and put the fear of action into the heart of the wrong doers.

👇👏👌✌👍

Could not stop posting 

A man who has gone out of his town comes back and finds that his house is on fire.

It was one of the most beautiful houses in the town, and the man loved the house the most! Many people were ready to give double price for the house, but he had never agreed for any price and now it is just burning before his eyes.

And thousands of people have gathered, but nothing can be done, the fire has spread so far that even if you try to put it out, nothing will be saved. So he becomes very sad.

His son comes running and whispers something in his ear: 

"Don't be worried. I sold it yesterday and at a very good price ― three times.The offer was so good I could not wait for you. Forgive me."

Father said, "thank God, it's not ours now!"  Then the father is relaxed and became a silent watcher, just like 1000s of other watchers.

Please think about it! Just a moment before he was not a watcher, he was attached. It is the same house....the same fire.... everything is the same...but now he is not concerned. In fact started enjoying it just as everybody else in the crowd.

Then the second son comes running, and he says to the father, "What are you doing? You are smiling ― and the house is on fire?" The father said, "Don't you know, your brother has sold it."
He said, "we have taken only advance amount, not settled fully. I doubt now that the man is going to purchase it now."

Again, everything changes!!

Tears which had disappeared, have come back to the father's eyes, his smile is no more there, his heart is beating fast. The 'watcher' is gone. He is again attached.

And then the third son comes, and he says, "That man is a man of his word. I have just come from him. He said, 'It doesn't matter whether the house is burnt or not, it is mine.
And I am going to pay the price that I have settled for. Neither you knew, nor I knew that the house would catch on fire.'" 

Again the joy is back and family became 'watchers'! The attachment is no more there.

Actually nothing is changing!

just the feeling that "I am the owner! I am not the owner of the house!" makes the whole difference.

This simple methodology of watching the mind, that you have nothing to do with it..Everything starts with a Thought !

Most of the thoughts are not yours but from your parents, your teachers, your friends, the books, the movies, the television, the newspapers. Just count how many thoughts are your own, and you will be surprised that not a single thought is your own. All are from other sources, all are borrowed ― either dumped by others on you, or foolishly dumped by yourself upon yourself, but nothing is yours.

Sow a thought, you reap an action.
Sow an act, you reap a habit.
Sow a habit, you reap a character.
Sow a character, you reap a destiny..!
Good Morning!!!

02/05/16, 5:37 PM - natarajan ramu: ஏன் பாஜகவிற்கு ஓட்டளிக்கவேண்டும்?

1). 2 வருடங்கள் முடியப்போகிறது. ஒரு ஊழல் குற்றச்சாட்டைக் கூட பிரதமர் மேலோ, அமைச்சர்கள் மேலோ எதிர்க்க்ட்சிகளாலும் , பெற்றதாய் பிறந்த பொன்னாட்டை எட்டணாவிற்கு விற்கத் தயாராக இருக்கும் ஊடகங்களினாலோ , முன்வைக்கக்கூட முடியவில்லை.

2). பியுஷ் கோயல், சுரேஷ் பிரபு, கட்காரி, நிர்மலா சீதாராமன், போன்ற அமைச்சர்கள் தங்களது அமைச்சகத்தின் செயல்பாட்டை பளிங்கு போல் இணையத்தில் காட்டுகிறார்கள். அவர்களது அமைச்சகங்கள் செய்துள்ள கடினமான சாதனைகளை ஆய்வு செய்யும் அளவு எதிரிக் கட்சிகளில் விஷய ஞானம் இல்லை.

3). வெளிநாட்டுக்கு ரதகஜ துரகபதாதிகளுடன் உல்லாசப் பயணம் போன மன்மோகனார் பற்றி வாயே திறக்காத ஊடகங்கள் பிரதமரின் வெளிநாட்டுப் பயணத்தை கார்டூன் போட்டு தங்கள் அரிப்பை காட்டிக்கொண்டன.  ஆனால் அவரது முயற்சியினால் அன்னிய முதலீடுகள் குறிப்பிடத்தகுந்த அளவு அதிகரித்துள்ளது.

4). உள்ளூர் கேடிக் கவுன்சிலர்கள் படாடோபமாக இருக்க , நாட்டின் ராணுவ மந்திரி வரிசையில் நின்று குறைந்த கட்டண விமானத்தில் ஏறுகிறார். ராணுவ முதலீடுகளில் நேர்மையும் , வெளிப்படையான செயல்பாடும் நடப்பது தெரிகிறது. ராணுவக் கொள்முதல் முந்தைய அரசுகளைவிட மிகவும் அதிகரித்திருக்கிறது, தேசப் பாதுகாப்புக் கருதி.  ஆனால் முந்தைய ஆட்சிபோல் ஹெலிகாப்டர் தொடங்கி பீரங்கி வரை ஊழல் இல்லை. 

5).பிரதமர் வாரம் தவறாது , ஊடகத் தரகர்களின்றி மக்களுடன் வானொலி மூலம் உரை நிகழ்த்துகிறார். தன்னுடைய செயல்பாடு, அரசின் செயல்பாடு, சந்திக்கும் சவால்கள், இந்தியாவைப் பற்றித்தான் கொண்டுள்ள கனவு பற்றி ஊடகக் கருத்துச் சேர்ப்பின்றி சொல்கிறார்.

6).நீதித்துறையில் அரசின் தலையீடு அறவே இல்லை. அத்துறையின் மீது , மக்கள் நம்பிக்கையை வளர்க்கும் வண்ணம் அரசும் வழக்குகளைக் கோர்ட்டில் தீட்டுகிறது, சந்திக்கிறது. சொன்ன முறை சற்று தவறுதான் ....ஆனால் நாட்டின் தலைமை நீதிபதி அதிகப் பணிச்சுமை பற்றி நேரடியாக பிரதமரிடம் சொல்லும் வாய்ப்பு இருக்கிறது. சகுனித்தனமாக , தலைமை நீதிபதியும் ஊடகங்களின் துணையை நாடவில்லை. அது நம்பிக்கையின் அடையாளம்.

7).நாட்டின் சுத்தம் சுகாதாரம் பற்றி பிரதமரே அக்கறை எடுத்து திட்டங்கள் வகுத்து செயல் படுத்துகிறார்.ஸ்வச் பாரத் இன்று சிறு குழந்தைகள் அளவில் தெரிந்திருக்கிறது. இது வருங்காலத்தின் நம்பிக்கை.

8).லோக்சபா, ராஜ்யசபாவில் அநாகரீக நடத்தைகள் இல்லை. பாஜக பிரதிநிதிகளிடம் நாகரீகமும், நகைச்சுவையும் மட்டுமே மின்னுகிறது. "ஸ்வாமி! ஹராம் கோர்! "என்று வசைபாடி மிரட்டும் காங்கிரஸின் கழிவறை நடவடிக்கைகளுக்கும் பாஜகவின் நடவடிக்கைகளுக்கும் உள்ள வேறுபாடு தெள்ளத்தெளிவாகிறது.

9). வெளிநாட்டுவாழ் இந்தியர்களுக்கு சுஷ்மா ஸ்வராஜ்ஜும், வி.கே.சிங்கும் எளிதில் அணுகக்கூடியவர்களாக இருக்கிறார்கள். என் அரசு என்னைக் கைவீட்டு விடாது என்ற நம்பிக்கை இன்று ஒவ்வொரு வெளிநாட்டு வாழ் இந்தியனிடமும் வந்துள்ளது. சவுதி அரேபியா வந்த பிரதமர் சாதாரணத் தொழிலாளிகளோடு கலந்து பேசுகிறார். அவர்களோடு லேபர் காம்ப்பில் உணவைப் பகிர்ந்துகொள்கிறார்.

10). மத்திய அரசு அலுவலகங்களில் ஊழல் பெருமளவு குறைந்து, செயல்பாடு தரமானதாக இருப்பதை பல நேரங்களில் மோதியை எதிரியாகக் கருதுபவர்கள் கூட ஒப்புக்கொள்ளும் தருணம். வறட்டு வாதங்களால் மோதியை எதிர்ப்பவர்கள்கூட பதுங்கும் ஒரு நிலை , ஆக்கப்பூர்வமாக உருவாகியுள்ளது.

11). டிசாஸ்டர் மானேஜ்மெண்ட் எனும் பேரழிவு நேர மேலாண்மை ஏமன் தொடங்கி கேரளா வரை அரசு நடைமுறைப்படுத்திக் காட்டியிருக்கிறது.

13). தங்கள் கட்சி ஆளும் மாநிலம் ,ஆளாத மாநிலம் என்ற பாகுபாடின்றி அரசு திட்டங்களைச் செயல்படுத்துகிறது.

14).வெளிநாட்டு உறவுகளில் உலகின் அனைத்து கௌரவமான நாடுகளுடனும் நல்ல உறவு உருவாக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. பாகிஸ்தான், சைனா அந்த கௌரவமான நாடுகள் வரிசையில் இல்லாதது நம்முடைய பிழையில்லை. அனைத்துத் துறையிலும் தோற்றுப்போன பாகிஸ்தானும், நம்பகத்தன்மை இல்லாத சைனாவும் மாறும் வரை மோதிக்கு 98/100 மட்டுமே!

15).வறட்சி நிவாரணம் பல மாநிலங்களில் மத்திய அரசு நேராகத் தலையிட்டு போர்க்கால நடவடிக்கைகள் மேற்கொண்டுள்ளது இதுவே முதல் முறை.

கடந்த 2 வருடங்களில் ,,,இதுவரை 60+ வருடங்களில் இல்லாத ஒரு எதிர்பார்ப்பும், நம்பிக்கையும் மக்களிடம் வந்துள்ளது,  

இன்னும்  பாலும் , தேனும் ஓடவில்லை ....... பளிங்குபோல சாலைகள் இல்லை ....குற்றங்கள் குறைந்தாலும் அவை முற்றிலுமாக ஒழிக்கப்படவில்லை .........இவை எல்லாம் இருந்தாலும்  இந்த அரசு நேர்மையானது, செயல் படக்கூடிய அரசு என்ற எளிமையான நம்பிக்கை வந்துள்ளது. அந்த ஒரு காரணம் போது பாஜகவிற்கு வாக்களிக்க!

வெற்றி பெரும் வாய்ப்பு இருக்கிறது என்று நினைப்பவர்களுக்கே வாக்களித்துப் பழகிவிட்டோம்...மாறுதலாக ......இம்முறை வாக்களித்து ஒருகட்சியை வெற்றி வாய்ப்பைப் பெறச் செய்யலாமே!

பாஜகவிற்கு போடப்படும் ஓட்டு ,

மோதி என்ற நல்ல மனிதனுக்குப் போடும் ஓட்டு!
மோதி என்ற நம்பிக்கைக்குப் போடப்படும் ஓட்டு!

முடிந்த அளவு பகிருங்கள். சென்றடையட்டும் எல்லா இடங்களுக்கும்.

07/05/16, 8:05 AM - Pornima Akka: Another fantastic video @Mani mama
07/05/16, 1:32 PM - natarajan ramu: An eight-year-old child heard her parents talking about her little brother. All she knew was that he was very sick and they had no money left. They were moving to a smaller house because they could not afford to stay in the present house after paying the doctor's bills. Only a very costly surgery could save him now and there was no one to loan them the money. 

When she heard her daddy say to her tearful mother with whispered desperation, 'Only a miracle can save him now', the little girl went to her bedroom and pulled her piggy bank from its hiding place in the closet. She poured all the change out on the floor and counted it carefully. 

Clutching the precious piggy bank tightly, she slipped out the back door and made her way six blocks to the local drugstore. She took a quarter from her bank and placed it on the glass counter. 

"And what do you want?" asked the pharmacist. 

"It's for my little brother," the girl answered back. "He's really very sick and I want to buy a miracle." 

"I beg your pardon?" said the pharmacist. 

"His name is Andrew and he has something bad growing inside his head and my daddy says only a miracle can save him. So how much does a miracle cost?" 

"We don't sell miracles here, child. I'm sorry," the pharmacist said, smiling sadly at the little girl. 

"Listen, I have the money to pay for it. If it isn't enough, I can try and get some more. Just tell me how much it costs." 

In the shop was a well-dressed customer. He stooped down and asked the little girl, "What kind of a miracle does you brother need?" 

"I don't know," she replied with her eyes welling up. "He's really sick and mommy says he needs an operation. But my daddy can't pay for it, so I have brought my savings". 

"How much do you have?" asked the man. 

"One dollar and eleven cents; but I can try and get some more", she answered barely audibly. 

"Well, what a coincidence," smiled the man, "A dollar and eleven cents - the exact price of a miracle for little brothers." 

He took her money in one hand and held her hand with the other. He said, "Take me to where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents. Let's see if I have the kind of miracle you need." 

That well-dressed man was Dr Carlton Armstrong, a neurosurgeon. The operation was completed without charge and it wasn't long before Andrew was home again and doing well. 

"That surgery," her mom whispered, "was a real miracle. I wonder how much it would have cost." 

The little girl smiled. She knew exactly how much the miracle cost ... one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the faith of a little child. 

Perseverance can make miracles happen! Miracle can come in various forms - as a doctor, as a lawyer, as a teacher, as a police ,as a friend, as a stranger and many others..

A river cuts the rock not because of its power, but because of its consistency.

Never lose your hope & keep walking towards your vision.

Somewhere I felt it has closely touched my life...... there's a message for us all.....This kind of message has to be shared and please share this beautiful one....

🙏🌹🙏

Adi Shankaracharya Jayanthi

🙏🌹🙏

Born in a family as a blessed child as an incarnation of Shiva to Mother Aryambha and Father Shiv Guru in Kaladi Kerala, in a village on the banks of Purna River is the known first human philosopher of the world, whose poetic composition made as a child to bless on compassion to a poor women, when he went to take bhiksha, made to shower the rain of golden amlas. 

Having taken the blessings to become Santana at young age, he walked to his guru Govind Padacharya in present Madhya Pradesh. 

Given the order to save the Vedic Dharma, Shankara started his mission from Banaras after taking the blessings of Lord Vishwa Nath.

A revolutionary spiritual journey started at the young age made Shankara Re-establish the Vedic Dharma (Sanatan Hindu Dharma) by starting teaching four monasteries in Bharat dedicated to four Vedas and appointed his four main disciples as head of the math, which is continuing even today. 

Shankara has done such contribution to Present Hindu Dharma, No one can even imagine to do. His scriptural philosophical contribution and his principles of Advaita are best path to experience the divine. Chant Govinda ( Bhaj Govindam) is the famous composition of Shankara. He walked up to Shiv lok. He was last seen at Kedar by his disciples. 

His 32 years of life was completely dedicated to Dharma and the National integration. Shankar's birth thus holds high reverence to All Dharmic Followers in present India.

Let us celebrate Adi Shankaras Birth Anniversary. 

#JaiShankara 
🙏🌹🙏

13/05/16, 2:58 PM - Paiya perrippa: TATA Rules the Heart of People:!!!!
There is a blood bank inside the Tata Motors premises in Jamshedpur (there are blood banks in other plants as well). This rule also applied in Tatasteel too.If you donate a bottle of blood, not only you are given off for that day, but you can also avail an extra leave within 7 days of donating the blood. Employees use it to extend their holidays. So, there is no shortage of leaves ever!! Needless to say, Tata loses several man-hours through this policy.
Once while having a conversation with the employees of the company, Ratan Tata was asked a question (by a senior official), "People take undue advantage of the policy. We lose several man-hours due to this. The blood is replenished within 24 hours, you know. Why to give that extra holiday within 7 days of donating blood."
Ratan Tata smiled. He always does. And then came a calm reply. "Encouragement is something I don't need to teach you. Only a few people donate because they want to. Talking about man-hours, we may be losing some man-hours doing that, but have you ever thought of the number of man-hours that get added to the person's life who receives that blood in the time of necessity? I am ready to sacrifice some of our man-hours for the better good of humanity."
 A gem, a true gem of a person.!!!

உங்கள் ஞானம் உங்களோடு அழிந்து விடக் கூடாது , என் மூலம் இந்த உலகம் பயன் பெற உங்கள் ஞானத்தை உபதேசிக்க வேண்டும் , என வேண்டினான் .

இராவணன் உபதேசித்தான் ........

1 . உன் சாரதியிடமோ , வாயிற் காப்போனிடமோ, சகோதரனிடமோ பகை கொள்ளாதே . உடனிருந்தே கொல்வர்.

2 .தொடர்ந்து நீ வெற்றிவாகை சூடினாலும் , எப்போதும் வெல்வோம் என எண்ணாதே .

3 .உன் குற்றங்களை சுட்டிக் காட்டும் நண்பனை நம்பு .

4 .நான் அனுமனை சிறியவன் என எடைபோட்டது போல் , எதிரியை எளியவன் என எடை போட்டு விடாதே .

5 . வானின் நட்சத்திரங்களை வளைக்க முடியும் என நம்பாதே , ஏனெனில் அவை உன் வழிகாட்டிகள்.

23/05/16, 5:11 PM - Paiya perrippa: ஆசை !! - 

கங்கையில் ஒரு வியாபாரி குளித்துக் கொண்டிருந்தான். அப்போது அழகான கைத்தடி ஒன்று மிதந்து வந்தது. அதை எடுத்துக் கொண்டு கரையை நோக்கி நீந்தினான் அவன். அப்போது ஒரு நீர்ச்சுழலில் மாட்டிக் கொண்டான்.தப்பிக்கக் கடும் முயற்சி செய்தான்.ஒரு வழியாகப் போராடி உயிர் பிழைத்தான். ஆனால் அந்தக் கைத்தடி எங்கோ நழுவிப் போய் விட்டது.

கரைக்கு வந்த அவன் அழகான கைத்தடியை இழந்து விட்டேனே என்று கதறினான். அங்கு இருந்த ஒரு துறவி, ''அய்யா, நீங்கள் குளிக்க வெறுங்கையுடன் வந்ததை பார்த்தேனே? இப்போது கைத்தடியை நழுவ விட்டதாகக் கூறுகிறீர்களே?'' என்று கேட்டார். 
வியாபாரி நடந்ததைக் கூறினான்.

துறவி சொன்னார், ''அய்யா, உங்களைப் பார்த்தால் எனக்கு சிரிப்பு வருகிறது. கங்கையில் கைத்தடி மிதந்து வந்தது. இப்போதும் அது மிதந்து கொண்டு போகிறது. அப்படி இருக்கையில் அது உங்கள் கைத்தடி என்று எப்படிக் கூறுகிறீர்கள்? அந்தக் கைத்தடியை இரண்டு நிமிடங்கள் தங்கள் கையில் வைத்திருந்ததனால் அது உங்களுடையது என்று சொந்தம் கொண்டாட உரிமை பெற்று விட்டீர்களா?''

வாழ்க்கையில் எதுவும் நிச்சயமில்லை. பிறக்கும் போது யாரும் எதையும் கொண்டு வருவதில்லை. இறக்கும் போதும் எதையும் கொண்டு போவதில்லை. ஆனால் வாழ்வில் பலவற்றை உரிமை கொண்டாடுகிறோம். நமது துன்பங்களுக்கெல்லாம் அது தான் காரணம்.

24/05/16, 7:29 AM - natarajan ramu: Came through one of the Worth a read message. Thought of sharing with u....

"Mom, I am a genetic scientist. I am working in the US on the evolution of man. Theory of evolution, Charles Darwin, have you heard of him? " Vasu asked. 
 
His Mother sat down next to him and smiled, "I know Darwin, Vasu. I also know that what you think he discovered is old news in India."

" Yeah sure Mom!" Vasu said with sarcasm.

"Well if you are too smart then listen to this, " his Mother countered." Have you heard of Dashavatar? The ten avatars of Vishnu?" Vasu nodded. 

"Then let me tell you what you and Mr. Darwin don't know. Listen carefully- The first avatar was the Matsya avatar, it means the fish. That is because life began in the water. Is that not right?" Vasu began to listen with a little more attention.

"Then came the Kurma Avatar, which means the tortoise, because life moved from the water to the land. The amphibian. So the Tortoise denoted the evolution from sea to land. 

Third was the Varaha, the wild boar, which meant the wild animals with not much intellect, you call them the Dinosaurs, correct? " Vasu nodded wide eyed.

"The fourth avatar was the Narasimha avatar, half man and half animal, the evolution from wild animals to intelligent beings. 

Fifth the Waman avatar, the midget or dwarf, who could grow really tall. Do you know why that is? Cause there were two kinds of humans, Homo Erectus and the Homo Sapiens and Homo Sapiens won that battle." Vasu could see that his Mother was in full flow and he was stupefied.

"The Sixth avatar was Parshuram, the man who wielded the axe, the man who was a cave and forest dweller. Angry, and not social. 

The seventh avatar  was Ram, the first thinking social being, who laid out the laws of society and the basis of all relationships.

 The eight avatar was Krishna, the statesman, the politician, the lover who played the game of society and taught how to live and thrive in the social structure. 

The Ninth avatar, the Buddha, the man who rose from Narasimha and found man's true nature. The nature of Buddha, he identified man's final quest of enlightenment. 

And finally, my boy, will come Kalki, the man you are working on. The man who will be genetically supreme."

Vasu looked at his Mother speechless. "This is amazing Mom, how did you.. This makes sense!"

"Yes it does Vasu! We Indians knew some amazing things just didnt know how to pass it on scientifically. So made them into mythological stories. 

Mythology makes sense. Its just the way you look at it - Religious or Scientific. Your call. 😳😳👍🏻

24/05/16, 6:23 PM - Paiya perrippa: Do you Know why  IRCTC does not allow you to choose seats? Would you believe that the technical reason behind this is PHYSICS.

Booking a seat in a train is far more different than booking a seat in a theatre.

Theatre is a hall, whereas train is a moving object. So safety concern is very high in trains. 

Indian railways ticket booking software is designed in such a way that it will book tickets in a manner that will distribute the load evenly in a train. 

Let me take an example to make things  more clear : Imagine there are sleeper class coaches in a train numbered S1, S2 S3... S10, and in every coach there are 72 seats. 

So when some one first books a ticket, software will assign a seat in the middle coach like S5, middle seat numbered between 30-40, and preferably lower berths (Railways first fills the lower berths than upper one so as to achieve low centre of gravity.) 

And the software books seats in such a way that all coaches have uniform passenger distribution and seats are filled starting from the middle seats (36) to seats near the gates i.e 1-2 or 71-72 in order from lower berth to upper. 

Railways just want to ensure a proper balance that each coach should have for equal load distribution. 

That is why when you book a ticket at the last, you are always allotted an upper berth and a seat numbered around 2-3 or 70, except when you are not taking a seat of someone who has cancelled his/her seat. 

What if the railways book tickets randomly ? A train is a moving object which moves around at a speed of around 100km/hr on rails. 
So there are a lot of forces and mechanics acting on the train. 

Just imagine if S1, S2, S3 are completely full and S5, S6 are completely empty and others are partially  full. When the train takes a turn, some coaches face maximum centrifugal force and some minimum, and this creates a high chance of derailment of the train. 

This is a very technical aspect, and when brakes are applied there will be different braking forces acting at each of the coaches because of the huge differences in weight of coach, so stability of train becomes an issue again.  

I felt that this is a good information worth sharing, as often passengers blame the Railways citing inconvenient seats/ berths allotted to them.

25/05/16, 2:46 PM - Paiya perrippa: I got all my answers..Try this..

A rare conversation between Krishna & Today's Arjun.  Read it loud to family,
it's one of  the best message I have come across...

1. Arjun :- *_I can’t find free time. Life has become hectic._*

Krishna:- *Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free.*

2. Arjun :- *_Why has life become complicated now?_*

 Krishna :- *Stop analyzing life... It makes it complicated. Just live it.*

3. Arjun :- *_Why are we then constantly unhappy?_*

Krishna :- *Worrying has become your habit. That’s why you are not happy.*

4. Arjun :- *_Why do good people always suffer?_*

Krishna :- *Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don’t suffer.*
*With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.*

5. Arjun :- *_You mean to say such experience is useful?_*

Krishna :- *Yes. In every term, Experience is a hard teacher. It gives the test first and the lessons later.*

6. Arjun :- *_Because of so many problems, we don’t know where we are heading…_*

Krishna:- *If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides the way.*

7. Arjun :- *_Does failure hurt more than moving in the right direction?_**

Krishna:- *Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you.*

8. Arjun :- *_In tough times, how do you stay motivated?_*

Krishna :- *Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.*

9. Arjun :- *_What surprises you about people?_*

Krishna :- *When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?"*

10. Arjun :- *_How can I get the best out of life?_*

Krishna:- *Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.*

11. Arjun :- *_One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered._*

Krishna:- *There are no unanswered prayers. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.*

Stay Happy Always.....!!!😊👍

26/05/16, 9:47 AM - Paiya perrippa: Duryodhan & Rahul Gandhi - both without talent. but yet wanted to be rulers on the principle of birth-rig
ht.

Bhishma & Advani -  Never crowned. got respect & yet became helpless at the end of their lives.

Arjun & Narendra - Both talented. reached the highest position due to being on the side of dharma. but realise how difficult it is to follow and practice.

Karna & Manmohan Singh - Both intelligent. but never reached anywhere being on the side of adharma.

Shakuni & Kejriwal - Both never fought a war, just played dirty tricks.

Dhritrashtra & Sonia - Both were blind for love of their sons.

And Last - Krishna And Abdul Kalam - We celebrate both of them but do not follow what they taught and preached. 

That is Mahabharat & This is Bharat...

28/05/16, 10:55 AM - Paiya perrippa: அன்னை தெராசாவைப் பற்றி கிரிக்கெட் வீரர் சித்து பகிர்ந்துக்கொண்ட சாட்சியை வாசியுங்கள்.

1991-92ம் வருடங்களில், ஒரு டெஸ்ட் மேட்ச் விளையாடுவதற்கு ஊதியமாக எங்களுக்கு ரூபாய் 10,000 வழங்கப்படுவது வழக்கம். ஒருமுறை கல்கத்தாவில் நடந்த ஒரு போட்டியின்போது அப்படி எனக்குக் கிடைத்த பணத்தை எடுத்துக்கொண்டு, அன்னை தெரசாவைக் கட்டாயம் சந்திக்கவேண்டும்.. அவர் செய்துவரும் தன்னலமற்ற சேவைக்காக அவருக்கு இந்தப் பணத்தைக் கொடுத்தேயாகவேண்டும்” என்று எனக்குள் ஓர் உந்துதல் ஏற்பட்டு, அவ்வாறே அவரது ஆசிரமத்துக்குச் சென்றேன். “Sisters of Charity” என்ற அந்த அலுவலகம் மிகச்சிறியதாய் இருந்தது. அங்கே இருந்த கன்னியாஸ்திரிகளிடம் ‘Where is Mother?’ என்று கேட்டேன். அதற்கு அங்கே இருந்த ஒரு கன்னியாஸ்திரி, ‘Mother is at the ‘Home for the dying’ என்றார். எனக்கு ‘Home for the dying’ என்று அவர் கூறியதன் பொருள் விளங்கவில்லை. அவர்கள் என்னை அந்த அலுவலகத்தின் பின்புறம் இருந்த ஒரு கட்டிடத்துக்கு அழைத்துச் சென்றனர்.

அந்தக் கட்டிடத்தினுள் தங்களது வாழ்வின் கடைசி மணித்துளிகளை எண்ணிக்கொண்டிருக்கும், மரணப்படுக்கையில் இருக்கும் நோயாளிகள் தங்கவைக்கப்பட்டிருந்தனர்.

நான் உள்ளே நுழைந்தபோது அந்த கட்டிடத்தினுள்ளிருந்து ஒரு சகிக்க இயலாத நாற்றம் வந்துகொண்டிருந்தது. அழுகிக்கொண்டிருக்கும் மாமிசத்திலிருந்து வருவதுபோன்றதான அந்த நாற்றத்தின் நெடி குமட்டலை வரவைத்தது. அதைச் சகித்துக்கொண்டு அந்த சிறிய சந்தின் வழியாக நான் நடந்து சென்று ஒரு அறையை அடைந்தேன்.

அங்கேதான் முதன்முதலாக அன்னைத் தெரசாவைக் கண்டேன். தன் மரணப்படுக்கையிலிருந்த நீண்ட தலைமுடியைக் கொண்ட ஒரு மனிதன் அங்கே படுக்கவைக்கப்பட்டிருந்தான். அவனது உடலில் ஆடை எதுவும் காணப்படவில்லை. ஒரு துணி மட்டும் அவனது இடுப்பின் கீழே போர்த்தப்பட்டிருந்தது. அவன் உடல்முழுவதும் அழுகி, புண்களில் இருந்து சீழ் வடிந்துகொண்டிருந்தது. அன்னை, மிகுந்த அன்புடன் அந்தப் புண்களில் வழிந்துகொண்டிருந்த சீழை ஒரு துணியினால் துடைத்துக்கொண்டிருந்தார். அவன் மிகுந்த வேதனையில் துடித்துக்கொண்டிருந்தான். அவன் உடலிலிருந்து வந்த நாற்றம் என் குடலைப்புரட்டியது.

ஒரு நிமிடம் கூட ஆகியிருக்காது. அந்தக் கட்டிடத்தினுள் இருந்து நான் வயிற்றைப் பிடித்துக்கொண்டு வெளியே ஓடிவந்தேன்… NavjotSingh Sidhu .. International Cricketer அங்கிருந்த சாக்கடையில் பெரும் குமட்டலுடன் வாந்தியெடுத்தான்.

பத்து நிமிடங்கள் கழித்து அன்னை தெரசா என்னிடம் வந்தார். புன்னகையுடன், ‘Yes My Son’ என்றார். ‘Mother I wanted to meet you’ என்றேன். ‘Come my son! Follow me!’ என்றவர் நடக்கத் துவங்கினார். அலுவலகம் வந்தோம். நான் மனம் நிறைய அகங்காரத்துடன் என் பாக்கெட்டிலிருந்த பத்தாயிரம் ரூபாயை எடுத்தேன். அங்கிருந்த மேஜையின் மேல் வைத்தேன். அவரை வணங்கி, ‘Mother.. You are an Instrument of Good... I have come here to assist you. I would be really obliged if you accept this’ என்றேன். அவர் என்னைப் பார்த்துப் புன்னகைத்தவாறு, ‘Son.. I don’t need your money. I need your time. Can you spend time with these people? Can you give me some days where you can nurse them?’ என்றார். என் கண்களிலிருந்து கண்ணீர் வழிந்தோடியது.

‘இவ்வுலகில் இப்படி உள்ளம் கொண்ட மனிதர்களும் இருக்கிறார்களா? நான் கொடுக்கும் பணத்தை மறுத்து, என்னை வந்து இந்த நோயாளிகளுடன் நேரம் செலவிடச் சொல்கிறாரே?’ என்று உறைந்துபோனேன்.

அந்த நாற்றத்தினுள் இரண்டு நிமிடங்கள் என்னால் நிற்கக் கூட இயலவில்லை. நான் எங்கிருந்து அவர்களுக்கு சேவை செய்வது? That was a life changing story for me.

‘பணம் கொடுத்து யாருக்கும் உதவி செய்துவிடலாம்’ என்ற என் எண்ணம் அன்று சுக்குநூறாகிப்போனது. ’பணத்தை விட அன்பும், நாம் பிறர்க்கு செய்யும் சேவையும் மிக மிக உயர்ந்தவை’ என்று அன்னை தெரசா அன்று எனக்கு உணர்த்தினார்.

28/05/16, 2:41 PM - Paiya perrippa: Michael Jordan was an African-American man, born in 1963, in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. 
He had four brothers and his father's wages were not sufficient to provide for the whole family. 
He grew up in a poor neighbourhood which was full of discrimination, to the point where he could not see any hope for the future.


When he was 13 years old, his father gave him a piece of used clothing and asked: "What do you think the value of this outfit would be?"

Jordan replied, "Maybe one dollar."

His father asked, "Can you sell it for two dollars? If you can sell it, it would mean that you are a big help 
to your father and mother. "

Jordan nodded his head, "I'll try, but no guarantee that I'll be successful."

Jordan carefully washed the clothes clean. Because they didn't have an iron, to smoothen out clothes, he levelled it with a clothes brush on a flat board, then kept it in the sun to dry. The next day, he brought the clothes to a crowded underground station. After offering it for more than six hours. Jordan finally managed to sell it for $2. He took the two dollar bill and ran home.

After that, everyday he was looked for used clothing, washed and ironed it and  sold it in the crowd. 
More than ten days later, his father again gave him a piece of used clothing, "Now think of a way that you can sell these clothes for 20 bucks?"

Jordan said, "How is it possible? This outfit can only fetch two dollars at the most. "

His father replied in an effort to inspire him, "Why don't you try it first? There must be a way."

Finally, Jordan got an Idea He asked for cousin's help to paint a picture of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse on the garment. Then he tried to sell it in the school where the children of the rich study. Soon a housekeeper, who was there to pick his master, bought clothes for his master. The master was a little boy of only 10 years but was very fond of clothes. He loved it so much and he gave a five dollar tip. 25 dollars was a huge amount 
for Jordan, the equivalent of a month's salary of his father.


When he got home, his father gave him yet another piece of used clothing. "Are you able to resell it at a price of 200 dollars?" His eyes lit up.

This time, Jordan accepted the clothes without the slightest doubt. Two months later a popular movie actress from the movie "Charlie's Angels", Farah Fawcett came to New York for her Movie promos. After the press conference, Jordan made his way through the security forces to reach the side of Farah Fawcett and requested her autograph on the piece of clothing. When Fawcett saw this innocent child asking for her autograph, 
she gladly signed it.

Jordan was shouting very excitedly, "This is a jersey signed by Miss Farah Fawcett, the selling price is 200 dollars!"He auctioned off the clothes, to a businessman for a price of 1,200 dollars!


Upon returning home, his father by broke into TEARS and said, "I am amazed that you did it My child! 
You're really great! "

That night, Jordan slept alongside his father. His father said, "Son, in your experience selling these three pieces of clothing, what did you learn about success?"

Jordan replied, "Where there's a will, there's a way."

His father nodded his head, then shook his head, "What you say is not entirely wrong! But that was not my intention. I just wanted to show you that a piece of used clothing which is worth only a dollar can also be increased in value, Then how about us - living & thinking humans? We maybe darker and poorer, but what's the difference? "

This thought enlightened young Jordan. Even a piece of used clothing could be made dignified, then why not me? There is absolutely no reason to underestimate myself.

From then on, Michael Jordan felt that his future would be beautiful and full of hope.

Our potential is so great, and should not be viewed small & low only because of our status, looks or wealth. Even a diamond is just a stone before it has been polished. 
Keep improving yourselves, trying your best and striving ahead!🙏

03/06/16, 9:56 AM - Pornima Akka: Can a history teacher explain this ...

Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.

John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.

Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.

John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.

Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.

Both their wives lost a child while living in the White House.

Both Presidents were shot on a Friday.

Both Presidents were shot in the head.


Now it gets really weird.

Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.

Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln.

Both were assassinated by Southerners.

Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.

Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.

Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.

John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.

Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.

Both assassins were known by their three names.

Both names are composed of fifteen letters.

Now hang on to your seat.

Lincoln was shot at the theater named "Ford."

Kennedy was shot in a car called "Lincoln" made by "Ford."

Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.

And here's the "kicker":

A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland.

A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.

AND...................:

Lincoln was shot in a theater and the assassin ran to a warehouse...

Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and the assassin ran to a theatre...

Worth a share ...!!

04/06/16, 11:14 AM - Paiya perrippa: Dear Government, 

Take my salary, give me all my taxes

Dear Mr Arun Jaitly FM, This budget has proved that it is anti Middle Class. The poor are taken care of by freebies and no taxes and  the rich don’t care about taxes as they earn huge salaries. We the middle class is suffering, we pay all your VAT, Cess, ST everything. Whatever little we do to make our struggle easy such as movies, hotels, small cars, electricity you all FMs tax them every year. We are sick of paying professional, education, Swach Bharath, Service TAX and VAT. Please listen to us. 

Don’t test our patience. Out of Rs.100 earned we only get benefit of Rs.20-30 rest goes in taxes. See Example below. 

A family of four on weekend for food at restaurant.

Petrol: 5 Ltr X Rs56.60= Rs. 283.
Tax collected on Rs 283 is Rs. 190

Resturant Bill Rs. 1000
Tax collected on Rs. 1000 = Rs. 203 (14.5%VAT, 5.6% ST, 0.2% SwachB Tax)
Service Charge 10% = Rs. 100
Total for taxes = Rs.303

Total outgoing = 283+1000+203+100= 1585
Note, this is post income tax so I will have to earn Rs. 2200 to manage this. Tax paid Rs. 660 on income

Summary Tax paid
Income Tax : Rs.660
Tax on Petrol: Rs.190
Tax on food: Rs. 203
Service Charge: Rs.100
TOTAL TAX PAID Rs. = Rs. 1153
Total spent from Salary Rs. 2200 

Actual value of goods received = Rs. 1047
Total TAX paid = Rs. 1153

WHAT IS THIS? Is the GOVT making us a fool 😰

30% income tax, 14% service tax, 0.5% Swach Bharat tax, 0.5% Agri tax, Vat 7.5%, cess and now tax on PPF and EPF.  Mr FM we do not know how you became a finance minister but you seem to be a total un-pat.

PLEASE PASS THIS TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

*படிப்புல எல்லாருக்கும் பின்னால இருந்தாலும் அவனோட அடிமுட்டாள்தனத்துக்கு ஒரு அளவே இல்லாம இருந்தது. . சகிக்க முடியாத ஹெட்மாஸ்ட்டர் T.C - யை கொடுத்து  அவன ஸ்கூல விட்டே வெளியேத்திட்டார்....*

*சங்கடத்தோட அவனோட அம்மா ஒத்தக்கடையிலிருந்து வீட்டைக் காலி பண்ணி  சென்னைல குடியேறி அங்க உள்ள ஒரு ஸ்கூல்ல அவன சேர்த்தாங்க.*

*25 வருஷத்துக்கு அப்புறம்.....*

*பழைய ஹெட்மாஸ்டர் இதயவால்வு சிகிச்சைக்காக சென்னைக்கு வருகிறார்.*

It had substance, promise, signals to Congressmen,  it had diplomatic friendly overtones,
veiled warnings to China & Pakistan without naming them,
It had history, geography, culture, scientific, defence  n trade partnership offer with mutual respect, n rare but true sprinkled with some sense of humour..which went down very well in Congress.

More than 1 hour of Extempore excellent speech.

16/06/16 வியாழக்கிழமை* தமிழ்மாதம் ஆனி 02 நாள்

*நிர்ஜலா ஏகாதசி*
ஆனி மாத வளர்பிறையில் வரும் ஏகாதசி நிர்ஜலா ஏகாதசி.  பாண்டவர்களில் மூத்தவரான தர்மபுத்திரர் ஒரு முறை வியாசரை தரிசித்தபோது அவரை வணங்கி "குருதேவா, துன்பங்கள் பலப்பல.  அவை எப்போது எப்படி மனிதர்களை பாதிக்கும் என்பது யாருக்கும் தெரியாது.  கலியுகத்திலோ, கேட்கவே வேண்டாம்.  அடை மழை போல, நேரம் காலம் பாராமல் அனைவரையும் படுத்தும்.  இந்த துன்பங்கள் நீங்கும்படியான ஒரு சுலபமான வழியைச் சொல்லுங்கள்" என வேண்டினார்.
"தர்மபுத்திரா, எல்லாத் துன்பங்களையும் நீக்கக் கூடியது ஏகாதசி விரதம் மட்டுமே.  ஏகாதசியன்று, உபவாசம் இருந்து பெருமானை பூஜிப்பதைத் தவிர சுலபமான வழி வேறெதுவும் இல்லை.  சகல விதமான சாஸ்திரங்களும் இதைத் தான் சொல்கின்றன" என்று பதில் சொன்னார் வியாசர்.
அருகில் இருந்து இதைக் கேட்ட பீமன், "உத்தமரான முனிவரே, என்னுடன் பிறந்தவர்கள் எல்லாம் ஏகாதசி விரதம் இருக்கிறார்கள்.  என் தாயும் மனைவியும்கூட ஏகாதசி விரதம் இருக்கிறார்கள்.  அவர்கள் எல்லோரும் என்னையும் ஏகாதசி விரதம் இருக்க சொல்கிறார்கள்  என்னால் செய்ய கூடியதா அது?  ஒரு வேளை  சாப்பிட்டுவிட்டு, அடுத்த வேளை சாப்பிடாமல் இருப்பதே என்னால் முடியாது.  என்னைப் போய்  முறையாக உபவாசம் இருந்து ஏகாதசி விரதம் இரு என்றால் நடக்கக் கூடியதா இது.  விருகம் என்னும் ஒரு தீ என் வயிற்றில் இருக்கிறது.  (பீமனின் வயிற்றில் அதிகமான பசியைத் தூண்டும் இந்தத் தீ இருந்ததால் தான் அவன் விருகோதரன் என அழைக்கப்பட்டான்)  ஏராளமான உணவைப் போட்டால் ஒழிய, என் வயிற்றில் இருக்கும் நெருப்பு அடங்காது.  வருடத்துக்கு ஒரே ஒரு நாள் என்னால் உபவாசம் இருக்க முடியும்.  எனவே எனக்குத் தகுந்தாற்போல நான் எல்லா விதமான ஏகாதசிகளின் பலனையும் பெரும் விதம் ஓர் ஏகாதசியை எனக்குச் சொல்லுங்கள்" என வேண்டினான்.
"கவலைப்படாதே பீமா.  உனக்காகவே அமைந்ததைப் போல ஒரு ஏகாதசி இருக்கிறது.  ஆனி மாதத்தில் வரும் வளர்பிறை ஏகாதசி அன்று, தண்ணீர்கூட அருந்தாமல் விரதம் இருக்க வேண்டும்.  அதனாலேயே அது நிர்ஜல ஏகாதசி எனப்படுகிறது  அந்த ஏகாதசி விரதத்தை நீ கடைப்பிடி" என வழிகாட்டினார் வியாசர்.  
வியாசரை வணங்கிய பீமன் நிர்ஜல ஏகாதசி அன்று தண்ணீர் கூடக் குடிக்காமல் விரதம் இருந்தான்.  மறுநாள் துவாதசி அன்று உணவு உண்டான்.
அன்று முதல் அந்த துவாதசி "பாண்டவ துவாதசி" என்றும், பீமன் விரதம் இருந்த அந்த ஏகாதசி "பீம ஏகாதசி" என்றும் அழைக்கப்படலாயிற்று.   துன்பங்கள் அனைத்தையும் போக்கும் ஏகாதசி இது.

20/06/16, 11:27 AM - Paiya perrippa: ஒரு வார்டு கவுன்சிலர் ஒரு முறை பதவியில் இருந்தால் குத்து மதிப்பாக எத்தனை லட்சங்கள், எத்தனை கோடிகள் சம்பாதிப்பார் என்பதையே நம்மால் கணக்கிட முடியாது. *ஆனால் மூன்று முறை திரிபுரா மாநில முதலமைச்சராக இருந்த ஒருவரது மொத்த சொத்தின் மதிப்பு வெறும் 10,800 ரூபாய்தான் என்றால் நம்பமுடிகிறதா?!!!!?*

அவருக்குச் சொந்தமாக வீடோ, வாகனமோ, செல்போனோ கிடையாது என்றால்
நம்புவீர்களா?

வேறொரு நாட்டில் இருக்கும் யாரோ ஒருவரைப் பற்றிச் சொல்லும் இன்டர்நெட் செய்தி இல்லை இது.

நமது பாரத நாட்டின் வட உச்சியில் உட்கார்ந்திருக்கும் *திரிபுரா மாநிலத்தின்* முதலமைச்சர் *மாணிக் சர்க்கார்தான்* அந்த உத்தமர்.

தற்போது 64 வயதாகும் மாணிக்சர்க்கார் சி.பி.எம் கட்சியைச் சேர்ந்த முழு நேர ஊழியர். 1981 இடைத்தேர்தல் மூலம் எம்.எல்.ஏ ஆனவர். 1998ல் திரிபுராவின் முதல்வரானவர்.

மூன்று ஐந்தாண்டுகள் முதல்வராய் இருந்த அவர், சமீபத்தில் நடந்த சட்டமன்றத் தேர்தலிலும் வெற்றி பெற்று நான்காம் முறையாக முதல்வராகியுள்ளார்.
அதிலும் கடந்த தேர்தல்களைக் காட்டிலும் கூடுதல் சீட்டுகள் பெற்றும், அவரது தொகுதியில் கூடுதல் வாக்குகள் பெற்றும் முதல்வர் பதவியைத் தக்க வைத்திருக்கிறார். சமீபத்தில் நடந்த தேர்தலுக்கு வேட்பு மனு தாக்கல் செய்தபோது தனது சொத்துக் கணக்கை வெளியிட்டார்.

அவரின் மொத்த சொத்தின் மதிப்பே
ரூ.10,800-தான். மனைவி, பிள்ளைகள் பேரில் சொத்தை குவித்திருப்பாரோ என்று குறுக்கே சிந்திக்க வேண்டாம்.
அரசு ஊழியராய் இருந்து ஓய்வுபெற்ற *அவரது மனைவி பாஞ்சாலியின் மொத்த சேமிப்பு ரூ 46,000-தான்*

*இந்தத் தம்பதிக்குக் குழந்தைகள் இல்லை*. சொந்த வீடோ, வாகனமோ கிடையாது. சொந்த வேலையாக வெளியே போனால், ஆட்டோ ரிக்ஷா பயணம்தான்.

*சர்க்காரின் அரசு காரில், சுழலும் சிவப்பு விளக்கும் கிடையாது*. *முதலமைச்சருக்கு என்று ஒரு சம்பளம் உண்டல்லவா?*
*_அதையும் கட்சிக்குக் கொடுத்து விடுகிறார் சர்க்கார்_*. *கட்சி பார்த்து அவருக்கு மாதச் சம்பளம் ரூ 5000 தருகிறது*.
*'இந்த பணமும் எனது மனைவியின் பென்சனும் எங்கள் எளிய வாழ்க்கைக்குப் போதுமானது'* என்கிறார் மாணிக் சர்க்கார்.

‘தினமும் காலை, அவர் உடுத்தும் உடைகளை அவரே துவைத்து போட்டு விட்டுத்தான் வெளியே கிளம்புவார்’ என்று தனது கணவர் பற்றி கூறுகிறார் பாஞ்சாலி...
‘எனது வெட்டிச் செலவு என்று பார்த்தால் தினசரி ஒரு சிறிய மூக்குப் பொடி மட்டை, 
ஒரு சிகரெட்தான்’ என்று முன்பு ஒருமுறை வெள்ளந்தியாய் கூறிய சர்க்கார்:
தற்போது அந்தப் பழக்கங்களையும் விட்டுவிட்டார்.

2009ல் சர்க்காரின் அம்மா மறைந்த போது, பூர்வீக வீடு ஒன்று அவருக்கு வந்து சேர்ந்தது. வாரிசு இல்லாத தனக்கு அந்த வீடு தேவையில்லை என்று கூறி, தனது தங்கைக்கு அந்த வீட்டைக் கொடுத்து விட்டார் சர்க்கார். சர்க்காரின் அப்பா ஒரு சாதாரண டெய்லர். ஆனாலும் 60களின் இறுதியிலேயே சர்க்காரை மேற்குவங்காள பல்கலைக்கழகத்தில் பட்டப்படிப்பு படிக்க வைத்தார் அவர்.

சர்க்காரின் குடும்பத்தினர், உறவினர்கள் எல்லோருமே சராசரி நடுத்தர வர்க்கத்துக்கும் கொஞ்சம் கீழே உள்ள குடும்பங்கள்தான்.

நண்பர்களே....... 
இந்த உத்தமர்,  நம் தமிழ்நாட்டிற்கு கிடைக்க வில்லையே!!!

பொறாமை கொள்ளுங்கள் நண்பர்களே....... 
இவரைப் போல நம்மால் இருக்க முடியவில்லையே என்று!!!

நீங்கள் உண்மையான இந்தியன் என்றால் அனைவருக்கும் பகிரவும்.
20/06/16, 11:31 AM - Paiya perrippa: ஒரு இளைஞன் வெளியூர் சென்று திரும்பும்போது பாலைவனத்தின் வழியே திரும்ப நேர்ந்தது. அப்போது ஒரு சுனையில் நீரை கண்டான். ஆவலுடன் ஓடிச்சென்று நீரை பருகியவன், அந்த நீரின் சுவையில் அளவற்ற மகிழ்ச்சியடைந்தான்.

குடிமக்களை சிறந்த முறையில் பரிபாலனம் செய்யக்கூடிய தனது நாட்டு மன்னனுக்கு அந்த நீரை கொடுத்தால் அவர் மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சியடைவார் என்று கருதி, தன்னுடைய தோல் பையில் அந்த நீரை கொஞ்சம் நிரப்பிக்கொண்டான். நான்கு நாட்கள் பயண முடிவில் தன்னுடைய ஊரைச் சென்றடைந்தவன், அரண்மனைக்கு சென்று அரசனிடம் அந்த நீரின் அருமை பெருமைகளை கூறி, உலகிலேயே இது போல சுவையான நீர் இருக்க முடியாது என்று கூறி, அதை அவருக்கு அளித்தான்.

ஆர்வமுடன் அதை கேட்ட மன்னன், அவனுக்கு நன்றி கூறி அதை வாங்கி குடித்தான். ஒரு வாய் குடித்தவன் சற்று நிறுத்த அந்த இளைஞன் ஆர்வமுடன் அவரது ரீயாக்ஷனை கவனித்துக்கொண்டிருந்தான். மன்னன் சிறிதும் தாமதிக்காமல் மொத்த நீரையும் குடிக்க ஆரம்பித்தான்.

இதை அருகே அமர்ந்து கவனித்துக்கொண்டிருந்த பட்டத்து ராணி, “எனக்கும் கொஞ்சம் அந்த நீரை கொடுங்களேன். எனக்கும் அதை குடிக்க ஆசையாக இருக்கிறது” என்று கூற, அவள் கூறியதை காதில் வாங்கிக்கொள்ளாமல் மொத்த நீரையும் குடித்து முடித்துவிட்டான் மன்னன்.

“பிரமாதம்… உண்மையில் இதுபோல ஒரு சுவையான ஒரு நீரை நான் இது வரை என் வாழ்க்கையில் அருந்தியதேயில்லை. உனக்கு எவ்வளவு நன்றி சொன்னாலும் தகும். நீ நீடூழி வாழ்க!” என்று வாழ்த்தி பரிசுகள் வழங்கி அனுப்புகிறார்.

இளைஞன் தனது மன்னனுக்கு அந்த அதிசய நீரை கொடுத்த சந்தோஷத்தில் விடைபெற்று சென்றான்.
அவன் சென்ற பிறகு, ராணி அரசனை கோபித்துக்கொள்கிறாள்.

“இருந்தாலும் உங்களுக்கு இத்தனை சுயநலம் ஆகாது. அந்த நீரை எனக்கும் கொஞ்சம் கொடுத்தால் என்ன குறைந்தா போய்விடுவீர்கள்? நான் கேட்க கேட்க காதில் வாங்கிக்கொள்ளாமல் மொத்தம் நீரையும் குடித்துவிட்டீர்களே…”

“இல்லை ராணி … நான் மொத்த நீரையும் குடிக்கவில்லை. அதில் கொஞ்சம் நீர் இன்னும் இருக்கிறது. வேண்டுமானால் நீ கொஞ்சம் குடித்துப் பாரேன்”

அரசன் சொல்ல, அந்த தோல் பையை எடுத்து பார்க்கிறாள். ஆம்… அதில் இன்னும் கொஞ்சம் நீர் இருக்கிறது.

ஆர்வமுடன் எடுத்து குடிப்பவள், ஒரு வாய் குடித்ததும்…. “சே… சே… என்ன தண்ணீர் என்ன இப்படி நாற்றமடிக்கிறது?” என்று கூறி அந்த நீரை உடனடியாக துப்பி விடுகிறாள்.

“இந்த தண்ணீரையா நீங்கள் உலகிலேயே சிறந்த நீர் என்று மெச்சிக்கொண்டீர்கள்? என்ன ஆயிற்று உங்களுக்கு??”

“தேவி… நீ நீரை தான் சுவைத்தாய். ஆனால் நான் அவன் என் மீது வைத்திருந்த அன்பை சுவைத்தேன். பாலைவனத்தில் தாகமெடுத்து அலைந்து திரிந்த அவனுக்கு ஒரு சாதாரண சுனை நீரே தேவாமிர்தம் போல இருந்திருக்கிறது. அதை மன்னனாகிய எனக்கு கொடுக்கவேண்டும் என்று கருதி தனது தோல் பையில் நிரப்பி கொண்டுவந்தான். எனவே தோலின் வாடையும் நீரில் ஏறிவிட்டது. நீரின் சுவை முற்றிலும் மாறிவிட்டது. அவன் இருக்கும்போது நீரை உனக்கு கொடுத்திருந்தால் நீ இப்போது செய்ததைப் போலவே அவன் முன்பு செய்திருப்பாய். அவன் மனம் வேதனைப்பட்டிருக்கும். அன்பைவிட சுவையானது வேறு எதுவும் இல்லை என்பது எனக்கு தெரியும் என்பதால் தான் நானே முழு நீரையும் குடித்தேன்” என்று விளக்கமளிக்கிறான்.

ராணி வெட்கி தலை குனிகிறாள்.
நம்மில் பெரும்பாலானோர் பொருளின் மதிப்பைத் தான் எடைபோடுகிறோமே தவிர அதனுள் பொதிந்திருக்கும் அன்பை அல்ல. அப்படி செய்வது உள்ளிருக்கும் முத்தை அறியாமல் சிப்பியை ஒதுக்குவது போன்று. நீங்கள் வாழ்க்கையில் அது போன்று எத்தனை முத்துக்களை தவறவிட்டிருக்கிறீர்கள் தெரியுமா?

மனித உணர்வுகளை நாம் மதிக்க கற்றுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும். நம் குழந்தைகளுக்கும் அவற்றை கற்றுத் தரவேண்டும்...,,

While as a Govt, Indian Govt may not be able to ban Chinese products due to WTO Agreement, etc, but as a citizen of India we can show our strength by hitting Chinese business where it hurts them more because Chinese economy is in dwindling trend right now.

27/06/16, 9:45 AM - Paiya perrippa: *What is MARKETING ?*

This is how a Professor explained Marketing Concepts to a class:
1. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party. You go up to her and say: "I am very rich. Marry me!"
- *That's Direct Marketing.*
😃
2. You are at a party with a bunch of friends and see a Gorgeous Girl. One of your friends goes upto her and pointing at you says: "He's very rich. Marry him!"
- *That's Advertising.*
😄
3. You are at a party and see a Gorgeous Girl. 
She walks up to you and says: "You are very rich! Can I marry you?"
- That's *Brand Recognition.*
😊
4. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party. You go upto her and say: "I am very rich. Marry me!" 
She gives you a nice hard slap on your face.
- That's *Customer Feedback.*
😛
5. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party. You go upto her and say: "I am very rich. Marry me!" 
And she introduces you to her husband.
- That's *Demand and Supply Gap.*
😜 
6. You see a Gorgeous Girl at a party. You go up to her and before you say: "I am rich, Marry me!",
Your wife arrives.
- That's *Restriction for Entering New Markets.*
😝
*Hope Concepts are clear...*.                           Good Night.

05/07/16, 8:50 AM - Paiya perrippa: யார் இந்த ரகுராம் ராஜன்?ஏன் அவர் பதவியை நீட்டிக்காதது பெரிதாக பேச படுகின்றது ?

தமிழ்நாட்டை பூர்விகமாக கொண்ட பொருளாதார வல்லுனரான ராஜன் 2008 உலக பொருளாதார சரிவை மிக சரியாக கணித்ததன் மூலம் பிரபலம் அடைந்தார் . மட்டும் இல்லாமல் உலக பொருளாதார இயக்கமான IMF இல் மிகக்குறைந்த வயதில் தலைமை பொருளாதார நிபுணராக பணியாற்றிய பெருமை உடையவர்.

2013 இல் உலகத்தில் பல நிறுவனங்கள் கோடி கணக்கில் சம்பளம் கொடுக்க தயாராக இருந்த போதும் அதை விட்டு விட்டு இந்திய பொருளாதரத்தை நிர்ணயிக்கும் முக்கியமான RBI governor பதவியை ஏற்றுக்கொண்டார்.அவர் செய்த முக்கியமான பணிகள் 

1) அவர் பதவி ஏற்ற பொழுது நம் பொருட்களின் விலைவாசியை குறிக்கும் பணவீக்கம் 11 சதவிதத்துக்கு மேல் இருந்தது அதை பாதிக்கு மேல் குறைத்து உள்ளார்.

2) இந்தியாவின் அந்நிய செலாவணி கையிருப்பை 25 லட்சம் கோடி(3.6 பில்லியன் அமெரிக்கா டாலர் ) அளவுக்கு உயர்த்தி உள்ளார்.

3) இந்தியா வங்கி துறையில் வார கடன்கள் மிகவும் அதிகமாக உள்ளதை சரி செய்யும் துணிச்சாலான நடவடிக்கைகளில் இறங்கினார் (Banks asset review).

4) இந்திய பொருளாதாரம் மிக சிறந்த ஒரு நிபுணரின் கையில் உள்ளது என்று உலக நிதி நிறுவனங்கள் முதலீடு செய்யும் சூழலை உருவாக்கினார் .

இது எல்லாவிற்றுக்கும் சிகரம் வைத்ததது போல 2016 அம் ஆண்டின் உலக முக்கியத்துவம் வாய்ந்த 100 நபர்களில் ஒருவராக Time நாளிதழால் தேர்வு செய்ய பட்டார்.

இவர் இப்போது பதவியை நீட்டிப்பு செய்ய விரும்பவில்லை என்று சொல்ல முக்கியமான காரணங்கள் .

1.துணிச்சலாக தனது முடிவுகளை எடுக்க கூடிய ராஜனின் செயல்கள் இந்தியாவில் உள்ள பல முறைகேடாக கடன் பெற்ற தொழிலதிபர்களின் வயிற்றில் புளியை கரைத்தது.அவர்கொடுத்த அழுத்தம் மூலமாக வங்கிகள் கொடுக்கப்பட்ட வாரா கடன்களை வசூல் செய்ய கிளம்பின.முன் போல் இல்லாமல் பெரும் கடன் வைத்துள்ள பணக்காரர்களிடமும் கடன் வசூல் செய்ய கிளம்பின.இதனால் தான் விஜய் மல்லயா,அணில் அம்பானி போன்ற முறையில்லாமல் கடன் வைத்துள்ள முதலாளிகளுக்கு நெருக்கடி உருவானது.விஜய் மல்லயா நாட்டை விட்டு ஓடினார்.அம்பானி போன்றோர் தங்கள் சொத்துக்களை விற்க வேண்டிய சூழ்நிலை உருவானது.இவர்கள் அரசியல்வாதிகள் மூலமாக ராஜனுக்கு நெருக்கடி கொடுக்க தொடங்கினர்.

2.அரசாங்கம் செய்யும் தவறுகளை சுட்டிக்காட்ட தயங்காத ராஜனின் செயல்பாடுகள் அரசியல்வாதிகளை பயம் கொள்ள செய்தது. மோடியின் "Make in India" வில் உள்ள குறைகள் போன்றவற்றை அவர் சுட்டிக்காட்டியது மற்றும் தொழில் அதிபர்கள் எளிதாக கடன் பெற வங்கி வட்டி விகிதத்தை குறைக்க சொல்லிய போது போது அவ்வாறு செய்வது விலை வாசியை உயர்த்தும் மற்றும் ஏழை ,நடுத்தர வர்க்கத்தை வர்கத்தை பாதிக்கும் என்று அவர் மறுத்தது அரசியல் வாதிகளை கோபம் செய்ய தொடங்கியது .

3.இவரால் பாதிக்கப்பட்ட பெரும் பண முதலைகள் சுப்ரமணியன் ஸ்வாமி மூலமாக காய் நகர்த்த தொடங்கினர்.ஸ்வாமி ராஜன் ஒரு தேச துரோகி என்று வெளிப்படையாக பிரதமருக்கு கடிதம் எழுதினார்.

இதன் தொடர்ச்சியாக மனம் வெறுத்த ராஜன் ,தான் செப்டம்பர் மாதத்திக்கு பிறகும் தான் விரும்பும் பேராசிரியர் பணிக்கு திரும்ப செல்வதாக அறிவித்து உள்ளார்.

ராஜன் போன்ற திறமைசாலிகள் இந்தியாவை விட்டு வெளியேறுவது இந்தியாவுட்கு பெரும் இழப்பு என்று அமர்த்தியா சென் போன்ற பல பொருளாதார மேதைகள் கருத்து தெரிவித்து உள்ளனர்.வரும் காலங்களில் இந்தியாவின் பொருளாதாரத்தை பாதிக்கும் என்றும் கருத்து தெரிவித்து உள்ளனர்.

எது எப்படியோ இந்திய பண முதலைகள் மற்றும் சுப்ரமணியன் ஸ்வாமி போன்ற அரசியல்வாதிகளுக்கு இந்த செய்தி பெரும் மகிழ்ச்சியை உண்டாக்கி உள்ளது.

இதுதான் நம் தேசத்தின் அவல நிலை!

10/07/16, 9:50 AM - Paiya perrippa: The 'root cause' analysis.??   You bet!!


A Management lecturer was talking about "Quality".


Lecturer : We all know Lord Ram went to spend 14 years in forest and Sita was kidnapped because of a "quality issue". 


Student : How is this anything to do with quality? 


Lecturer : Tell me why did Sita go to forest with Ram ?


Student : Because she was his wife and respected his every decision. 


Lecturer : OK but why did Ram go to forest ?


Student : Because his father Dasharatha told him to do so and he never disobeyed his father. 


Lecturer : OK why did Dasharatha send his son to forest ?


Student : Dasharatha offered his wife (Kaikeyi) two boons , and she chose to make use of them in the future. 

And she wanted her son to be king, so on the day of Rama's crowning, 

she asked Dasharatha to send Rama to forest and crown her son; reminding him of his promised boons.

 

Lecturer : So why did Dasharatha offer his wife two boons ?


Student : Because during a military campaign against Sambarasura, the wheel of  Dasharatha's chariot broke and Sambarasura's arrow pierced the King's armor. 

She nursed the wounded King back to health.

Touched by her courage and timely service, Dasharatha offered her two boons.


Lecturer: Hence Proved. The quality of Chariot's wheel was not up to the mark .. leading to kidnapping of Sita...!!!! 


[So, the Quality is very important and if the quality of Chariot's wheel was good, the Ramayana wouldn't have happened!]

17/07/16, 9:19 AM - Pornima Akka: *_Innocence at its best._*

A small boy parks his bicycle nearby the Parliament house and walks on...

A police constable stops him and asks: Why did you park your bicycle here.... don't you know about this road? Many MPs, sometimes CMs , even President and cabinet ministers and politicians pass from here...

The boy replied innocently : Don't worry, I have locked my bicycle.

19/07/16, 1:28 PM - natarajan ramu: ராம ஜபத்தின் மகிமை …..

ஒரு நாள் சக்கரவர்த்தி அக்பர் 
வேட்டைக்காக ஒரு பரந்த வனத்திற்குள் சென்றார்.

அவருடன் மந்திரி பீர்பாலும் சென்றார். 
ஆனால் காட்டுக்குள் சென்றவர்களுக்கு 
வழி தவறிப் போனது. கொடும் வனம், 
அதைவிட கொடிய பசி இருவரையும் 
வாட்டி வதைத்தது.

ஆனால் பீர்பாலோ அடர்ந்த வனத்தின் 
அழகில் மனதை பறிகொடுத்து விட்டார். 
உடனே ஒரு பெரியமரத்தின் கீழ் அமர்ந்து 
“ராம ராம” என்று ராம நாம ஜபத்தை 
ஜபிக்கத் தொடங்கினார்.

அக்பர் பசி தாங்க முடியாமல் பீர்பாலை 
நோக்கி, ஏதாவது உணவை சேகரித்துக் 
கொண்டு வாருங்கள். நிச்சயம் சிறிது 
தூரம் போனால் ஏதாவது வழி தென்படும் என்று கூற, பீர்பாலோ, அரசே என் வயிறோ உணவிற்கு ஏங்குகிறது. ஆனால் மனமோ 
ராம நாமத்திற்கு ஏங்குகிறது. அதனால் மன்னா இப்போது நான் உணவைப் போய் சேகரிக்கும் நிலையில் இல்லை என்று பதிலளித்தார்.

இதைக் கேட்டு சினம் கொண்ட அக்பர் 
தானே உணவை தேடிக் கொண்டு போனார். அவர் எதிர்பார்த்தது போலவே தொலைவில் ஒரு வீடு தென்பட விரைந்து சென்ற சக்கரவர்த்தி அக்பரை மனம் மகிழ்ந்து வரவேற்று, அறுசுவை உணவளித்து உபசரித்தனர் அவ்வீட்டினர்.

அக்பரும் மனம் கேளாமல் 
பீர்பாலிற்காகவும் உணவைக் 
கேட்டுப் பெற்று காட்டில்
மரத்தடியில் ராமநாமத்தை 
ஜபித்துக் கொண்டிருந்தவரை 
அணுகி அதை கொடுத்து
விட்டு ஏளனத்தோடு கேட்டார்.

“பீர்பால், இப்போதாவது தெரிந்ததா, நான் எடுத்த சரியான முடிவால் தான் இன்று 
உமக்கு உணவு கிடைத்தது. நீங்கள் 
ஜபித்துக் கொண்டிருக்கிறீர்களே 
இந்த ராமஜபம், அதுவா உங்களை பசியாற்றியது?”

உணவைப் புசித்து முடித்து விட்டு 
அமைதியாக பீர்பால், ‘அரசே ! 
உணவிற்காக மகாபெரிய சக்கரவர்த்தியான தாங்கள் ஒரு சாதாரண பிரஜையிடம் 
யாசிக்க நேர்ந்தது.

ஆனால் என் பிரபு ராமரோ எனக்கு 
உணவை மாமன்னரான உங்கள் கையில்
கொடுத்தனுப்பியுள்ளார்.

இதுதான் ராம ஜபத்தின் மகிமை’ என்று 
கூற, அக்பர் வாயடைத்துப் போய் நின்றார்.

[10/07, 19:56] ‪+91 97899 91211
‬: New drug in Schools...Please pass this on even if you do not have kids in school. Parents should know about this drug.This is a new drug known as 'strawberry quick '.There is a very scary thing going on in the schools right now that we all need to be aware of.There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks (the candy that sizzles and 'pops' in your mouth). It also smells like strawberry and it is being handed out to kids in school yards. They are calling it strawberry meth or strawberry quick.Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the hospital in dire condition. It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange.Please instruct your children not to accept candy from strangers and even not to accept candy that looks like this from a friend (who may have been given it and believed it is candy) and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc. immediately.Pass this message on to as many people as you can (even if they don't have kids) so that we can raise awareness and hopefully prevent any tragedies from occurring..!!

01/08/16, 6:43 PM - natarajan ramu: Have you read this before ? Drastic change in taxation methodology suggested to eliminate black money.

Anil Bokil , one of the key member of Arthakranti Sansthan was given time to share to PM Modi. He was given 9min for sharing but Mr Modi heard him for 2 hrs.


Arthakranti Proposal

What is Arthakranti Proposal and who hasgiven the proposal?

“Arthakranti Proposal” has been given by a Pune (Maharashtra) based “Arthakranti Sansthan” which is an Economic Advisory body constituted by a group of Chartered Accountants and Engineers. This funda has been patented by the Sansthan.

Arthakranti Proposal is an effective and guaranteed solution of Black Money Generation, Price rise and Inflation, Corruption, Fiscal Deficit, Unemployment, Ransom, GDP and industrial growth, terrorism and good governance.

What is in the Proposal ?

“Arthakranti Proposal has FIVE point of actions simultaneously.

(1) Scrap all 56 Taxes including income tax excluding import duty.

(2) Recall and scrap high denomination currencies of 1000, 500 and 100 rupees.

(3) All high value transaction to be made only through banking system like cheque, DD, online and electronic.

(4) Fix limit of cash transaction and no taxing on cash transaction.

(5) For Govt. revenue collection introduce single point tax system through banking system – Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) on only Credit Amount

Important Points to note:

(1) As on today total banking transaction is more than 2.7 lakh crores per day say more than 800 lakh crores annually.

(2) Less than 20% transaction is made through banking system as on today and more than 80% transaction made in cash only, which is not traceable.

(3) 78% of Indian population spend less than 20/- rupees daily why they need 1000/- rupee note.

What will happen if All FIFTY SIX Taxes including income tax scrapped :

(1) Salaried people will bring home more money which will increase purchasing power of the family.

(2) All commodities including Petrol, Diesel, FMCG will become cheaper by 35% to 52% .

(3) No question of Tax evasion so no black money generation.

(4) Business sector will get boosted. So self employment.

What will happen if 1000/ 500/ 100 Rupees currency notes recalled and scrapped :

(1) Corruption through cash will stopped 100%.

(2) Black money will be either converted to white or will vanish as billions of 1000/500/100 currency notes hidden in bags without use will become simple pieces of papers.

(3) Unaccounted hidden huge cash is skyrocketing the prices of properties, land, houses, jewellery etc and hard earned money is loosing its value; this trend will stop immediately.

(4) Kidnapping and ransom, “Supari killing” will stop.

(5) Terrorism supported by cash transaction will stop.

(6) Cannot buy high value property in cash showing very less registry prices.

(7) Circulation of “Fake Currency” will stop because fake currency printing for less value notes will not be viable.

What will happen when Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) is implemented :

(1) As on today if BTT is implemented govt can fetch 800 x 2% = 16 lakh crore where as current taxing system is generating less than 14 lakh crore revenue.

(2)When 50% of total transaction will be covered by BTT sizing 2000 to 2500 lakh crores, Govt will need to fix BTT as low as 1% to 0.7% and this will boost again banking transaction many fold.

(3) No separate machinery like income tax department will be needed and tax amount will directly deposited in State/Central/District administration account immediately.

(4) As transaction tax amount will be very less, public will prefer it instead paying huge amount against directly/indirectly FIFTY SIX taxes.

(5) There will be no tax evasion and govt will get huge revenue for development and employment generation.

(6) For any special revenue for special projects, govt can slightly raise BTT say from 1% to 1.2% and this 0.2% increase will generate 4,00,000 crores additional fund.

Effect of if implemented today :

(01)Prices of all things will come down.

(02)Salaried people will get more cash in hand.

(03)Purchasing power of Society will increase.

(04)Demand will boost, so will production and industrialisation and ultimately more employment opportunity for youth.

(05) Surplus revenue to the govt for effective health/ education/ infrastructure/ security/ social works.

(06) Cheaper and easy loans from banks, interest rate will come down.

(07) Tendency of society will changes from scarcity to quantity.

(08) Spare money for political system for clean politics,

(09) Prices of land/ property will come down,

(10) No need to export beef to cover up trade deficit

(11) Sufficient fund for research and development.

(12) Society will be free from “Bad elements”.

A very nice n simple compilation with logical impact. Worth sharing!!

04/08/16, 10:15 PM - Harish Kumaraswami: Nice message 👌

I had spent an hour in the bank with my dad, as he had to transfer some money.  I couldn't resist myself & asked...
 
''Dad, why don't we activate your internet banking?''

''Why would I do that?'' 
He asked...

''Well, then you wont have to spend an hour here for things like transfer. 

You can even do your shopping online. Everything will be so easy!'' 

I was so excited about initiating him into the world of Net banking.

He asked ''If I do that, I wont have to step out of the house? 

''Yes, yes''! I said. I told him how even grocery can be delivered at door now and how amazon delivers everything!

His answer left me tongue-tied. 

He said ''Since I entered this bank today, I have met four of my friends, I have chatted a while with the staff who know me very well by now.

You know I m alone...
 this is the company that I need. I like to get ready and come to the bank. I have enough time, it is the physical touch that I crave.

 Two years back I got sick, The store owner  from whom I buy fruits, came to see me and sat by my bedside and cried. 

When u r Mom fell down few days back while on her morning walk. Our local grocer saw her and immediately got his car to rush her home as he knows where I live. 

Would I have that 'human' touch if everything became online?

Why would I want everything delivered to me and force me to interact with just my computer? 

I like to know the person that I'm dealing with and not just the 'seller' . It creates bonds. Relationships. 

Does Amazon deliver all this as well?'''

10/08/16, 2:59 PM - Paiya perrippa: A superb.... story...👌

A 6 yr old boy was in the market with his 4 yr old sister........Suddenly the boy found that his sister was lagging behind.

He stopped and looked back. His sister was standing in front of a toy shop and was watching something with great interest.

The boy went back to her and asked,"Do you want something ?" The sister pointed at the doll. 
The boy held her hand and like a responsible elder brother, gave that doll to her.The sister was very very happy...

The shopkeeper was watching everything and getting amused to see the matured behaviour of the boy...

Now the boy came to the counter and asked the shopkeeper,

"What is the cost of this doll, Sir !"

The shopkeeper was a cool man and had experienced the odds of life. So he asked the boy with a lot of love n affection,"

Well, What can you pay ?"

The boy took out all the shells that he had collected from sea shore, from his pocket and gave them to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper took the shells and started counting as if he were counting the currency. Then he looked at the boy.The boy asked him worriedly,"Is it less ?

" The shopkeeper said," No,No...

These are more than the cost. So I will return the remaining." Saying so,he kept only 4 shells with him and returned the remaining. 
The boy, very happily kept those shells back in his pocket and went away with his sister...

A servant in that shop got very surprised watching all these. He asked his master," Sir ! You gave away such a costly doll just for 4 shells ???

"The shopkeeper said with a smile," Well, For us these are mere shells.
But for that boy, these shells are very precious. And at this age he does not understand what money is, but when he will grow up, he definitely will.
And when he would remember that he purchased a doll with the Shells instead of Money, he will remember Me and think that world is full of Good people.

It will help him develop a positive attitude and he too in turn will feel motivated to be Good !

WOW....WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD IT COULD BE.....

14/08/16, 9:38 AM - Paiya perrippa: What’s your managerial style: like Lord Ram or Lord Krishna?

In Hindu mythology there are two great epics. One is called Ramayan and other is called Mahabharata. The centre story of both these books is around victory of good on evil. In one story Lord Ram leads his army to defeat Ravana in his land,
While in the second Lord Krishna oversees Pandavas defeat Kauravas in the battle at Kurushektra.

In Ramayan, Lord Ram is the best yodhaa of his side.
He leads his army from the front. Strategizes & directs different people to do things which will meet the objectives. His people are happy to follow orders & want to get all the appreciation for being the best executors. Lord Ram set direction & also tells people what to do during difficult times.

Ultimately they won the war & the final outcome was achieved.

On the other hand Lord Krishna told Arjuna, I won’t fight the battle. I won’t pick up any weapon; I would only be there on ur chariot as a charioteer. And he did what he said. He never picked up the weapon & he never fought.

Still, Pandavas won the war & final outcome was achieved.

So, what was different? It was their managerial style & it was also the type of people who were being lead.
Lord Ram was leading an army of ‘MONKEYS’ who were not skilled fighters & they were looking for direction. While on other hand, 

Lord Krishna was leading Arjuna who was one of the best archer of his time. While Lord Ram’s role was to show it & lead from the front, 

Krishna played the role of a coach whose job was to remove cobwebs from his protégée’s mind. Krishna couldn't teach Arjuna archery but he could definitely help him see things from a very different perspective.

Here are some of the basic differences in two styles:
Lord Ram- A skilled warrior, lead monkeys, was emotional, gave precise roles & instructions, motivated the army to fight for his cause;
Lord Krishna- works with best the professionals, provides strategic clarity, allows team members to take lead, fights for the cause of the team, did not depict his true emotions

Look at ur team/family & reflect what type of leader/parent u are,
One who keeps answering/solving problems for people/kids  Or 
Who asks relevant questions from their people/kids so that they can find their own solution.
Are u someone who tells/directs all the time  Or
Someone who clarifies doubts & allows their people/kids to find their own ways.
Are u someone who has monkeys in the team & the way u deal with it
Or u have the brightest experts in their area getting stuck with issues?  

Younger generation doesn't want you to tell or show how things are done, they want to know the meaning of their task and how it makes a difference in this world.
They are Arjuna’s who don’t necessarily seek more skill/knowledge but they need someone to clarify the cobwebs in their mind, if u still apply Lord Ram’s style on them, u are bound to fail as a manager
On the other hand if there are people who aren't skilled enough but rely on ur expertise to sail u through Lord Ram’s style is appropriate.

Isn't it good for us to reflect & think what managerial style will bring the best result for u and ur team/family ?

Is it Lord Ram or Lord Krishna?
The Managing Leader vs the Coaching Leader!

24/08/16, 10:48 PM - natarajan ramu: ஆஞ்சநேயரின் பரம பக்தர் ஒருவருக்கு சொக்கட்டான் விளையாட ஆசை! தன்னுடன் சேர்ந்து விளையாட ஆஞ்சநேயரே வரவேண்டும் என விரும்பினார்.

எனவே, மனமுருகி ஆஞ்சநேயரைப் பிரார்த்தித்தார். அவர் முன் தோன்றிய ஆஞ்ச நேயரும் பக்தரது விருப்பத்தை பூர்த்தி செய்ய ஒப்புக் கொண்டார். ஆனாலும் ஒரு நிபந்தனை விதித்தார். ''நான் விளையாட்டில் விட்டுக் கொடுக்க மாட்டேன். எனவே, தோற்றால் நீ வருத்தப்படக் கூடாது!'' என்றார். பக்தரும் சம்மதித்தார்.

இருவரும் விளையாட ஆரம்பித்தனர். பக்தர், ஒவ்வொரு முறையும் 'ஜெய் அனுமான்' என்றபடியே காய்களை உருட்டினார். ஆஞ்ச நேயர், 'ஜெய் ராம்' என்றபடி காய்களை உருட்டினார்.

ஒவ்வொரு முறையும் பக்தனே வெற்றி பெற்றான். 'சரி, அடுத்த முறை ஜெயிக்கலாம்!' என்று ஆஞ்சநேயர் மீண்டும் மீண்டும் விளையாட வெற்றி பக்தனின் பக்கமே! மனம் வருந்திய ஆஞ்ச நேயர், 'ஸ்வாமி, தங்கள் நாமத்தை உச்சரித்தும் எனக்கு தோல்வியா?!'  என்று ராமரிடம் பிரார்த்தித்தார். அவர் முன் தோன்றிய ராமன், 'ஆஞ்சநேயா... நீ, என் பக்தன் ஆதலால், உன்னிடம் என் சக்தி இணைந்துள்ளது. அவனோ உனது பக்தன். ஆதலால், அவனது சக்தியுடன் நம் இருவரது சக்தியும் இணைந்து விடுகிறது. இதுவே அவனது வெற்றிக்கு காரணம்!'' என்றார்

26/08/16, 10:05 AM - Paiya perrippa: *"கலியுகம் எப்படி இருக்கும்...?"*
பகவான் கிருஷ்ணரிடம் பீமன், அர்ஜூனன், நகுலன், சகாதேவன் ஆகியோர் மேற்கண்ட கேள்வியை கேட்டனர்...
அதற்கு மாதவன், "சொல்வதென்ன? எப்படி இருக்கும் என்றே காண்பிக்கிறேன்..." என்று கூறி...
நான்கு அம்புகளை நான்கு திசைகளிலும் செலுத்தி அவற்றை எடுத்துக் கொண்டு வருமாறு கூறினார்.
கோவிந்தனின் ஆணைப்படி நால்வரும் நான்கு திசைகளில் சென்றனர்.
முதலில் பீமன், அம்பை எடுத்த இடத்தில் ஒரு காட்சியை கண்டான்... அங்கு ஐந்து கிணறுகள் இருநதன. மத்தியில் ஒரு கிணறு, அதைச் சுற்றி நான்கு கிணறுகள்.
சுற்றியுள்ள நான்கு கிணறுகளில் சுவை மிகுந்த தண்ணீர் நிரம்பி வழிந்து கொண்டே இருந்தது. ஆனால் நடுவில் உள்ள கிணறு மட்டும் நீர் வற்றி இருந்தது...
இதனால் பீமன் சற்று குழம்பி, அதை யோசித்தபடியே அந்த இடத்தை விட்டு கிருஷ்ணரை நோக்கி நடநதான்.
அர்ஜூனன், அம்பை மீட்ட இடத்தில் ஒரு குயிலின் அற்புதமான குரலைக் கேட்டான். பாடல் கேட்ட திசையில் திரும்பிப் பார்த்தான் அர்ஜூனன், அங்கு ஒரு கோரமான காட்சியை கண்டான்...
அந்தக் குயில் ஒரு வெண்முயலை கொத்தித் தின்று கொண்டிருந்தது. அந்த முயலோ வலியால் துடித்துக் கொண்டிருந்தது. மெல்லிசை கொண்டு மனதை மயக்கும் குயிலுக்கு இவ்வளவு கொடிய மனம் உள்ளதே என்று எண்ணியபடி, குழப்பத்தோடு அங்கிருந்து நகர்ந்தான்.
சகாதேவன், கிருஷ்ணரின் அம்பை எடுத்துக் கொண்டு திரும்பி வரும் வழியில் ஒரு காட்சி கண்டான்...
பசு ஒன்று அழகிய கன்றுகுட்டியை ஈன்றெடுத்து, அதனைத் தன் நாவால் வருடி சுத்தம் செய்து கொண்டிருந்தது. கன்று முழுமையாக சுத்தம் ஆகியும் தாய்ப் பசு நாவால் வருடுவதை நிறுத்தவில்லை. சுற்றியிருந்த பலர் கன்றை பசுவிடம் இருந்து மிகவும் சிரமப்பட்டு பிரித்தனர். அதனால் அந்தக் கன்றுக்கு பலத்த காயங்கள் உண்டானது.
 'தாய் எப்படி பிள்ளையை காயப்படுத்த முடியும்?' என்ற குழப்பத்தோடு அவனும் கிருஷ்ணரை நோக்கி நடந்தான்.
அடுத்ததாக நகுலன், கண்ணனின் அம்பு ஒரு பெரிய மலையின் அருகில் இருப்பதைக் கண்டு எடுத்துக் கொண்டு திரும்பினான்.
அப்போது...
மலை மேலிருந்து பெரிய பாறை ஒன்று கீழே உருண்டு வந்தது. வழியில் இருந்த அனைத்து மரங்களையும் தடைகளையும் இடித்துத் தள்ளி, வேகமாக உருண்டு வந்தது.
அவ்வாறு வேகமாக வந்த அந்த பாறை, ஒரு சிறிய செடியில் மோதி அப்படியே நின்றுவிட்டது.
ஆச்சர்யத்தோடு அதைக் கண்ட நகுலன் தெளிவு பெற பகவானை நோக்கி புறப்பட்டான்.
இவ்வாறு பாண்டவர்கள் நால்வரும் கிருஷ்ணரிடம் வந்து சேர்ந்தனர்.
அவரவர் தாங்கள் கண்ட காட்சியையும், மனதில் உள்ள குழப்பத்தையும் ஞானக்கடலான கிருஷ்ணரிடம் கூறி, அதற்கான விளக்கத்தை கேட்டனர்.
கிருஷ்ணரோ வழக்கமான தன் மெல்லிய சிரிப்புடன் விளக்கினார்...
 "பீமா...! கலியுகத்தில் செல்வந்தர்களும், ஏழைகளும் அருகருகே தான் வாழ்வார்கள்... ஆனால், செல்வந்தர்கள் மிகவும் செழிப்பாக இருந்தாலும், தம்மிடம் உள்ளதில் ஒரு சிறு பகுதியைக் கூட ஏழைகளுக்குக் கொடுத்து உதவ மாட்டார்கள்...
ஒரு பக்கம் செல்வந்தர்கள் நாளுக்குநாள் செல்வந்தர்களாகவே ஆக, மற்றொரு பக்கம் ஏழைகள் ஏழ்மையில் வாடி வருந்துவார்கள்...
நிரம்பி வழியும் நான்கு கிணறுகளுக்கு நடுவில் உள்ள வற்றிய கிணற்றை போல்..." என்றார்.
பின்னர் அர்ஜூனனிடம் திரும்பி, கிருஷ்ணர்,
 "அர்ஜூனா! கலியுகத்தில் போலி ஆசிரியர்கள், மத குருக்கள், போன்றவர்கள் இனிமையாகப் பேசும் இயல்பும், அகன்ற அறிவும் கொண்டவர்களாக இருப்பார்கள்...
இருப்பினும் இவர்கள் மக்களை ஏமாற்றிப் பிழைக்கும் கயவர்களாகவே இருப்பார்கள்...
இனிய குரலில் பாடிக்கொண்டே, முயலை கொத்தித் தின்ற குயிலைப்போல...!" என்றார்.
தொடர்ந்து சகாதேவனிடம் கிருஷ்ணர், "சகாதேவா! கலியுகத்தில் பெற்றோர்கள் தங்கள் பிள்ளைகளின் மீதுள்ள கண்மூடித்தனமான பாசத்தால் அவர்கள் தவறு செய்தாலும் அதைப் பொருட்படுத்தாமல், பிள்ளைகளின் நெறி தவறிய வாழ்விற்கு தாங்களே காரணமாக இருப்பார்கள்...
இதனால் பிள்ளைகளின் எதிர்கால வாழ்க்கை துன்பப்பிடியில் சிக்கிக் கொள்ளும் என்பதை கூட மறந்து விடுவார்கள்...
இதையடுத்து, பிள்ளைகளும் வருங்காலத்தில் தீய வினைகளால் துன்பத்தை அனுபவிப்பார்கள்.
இவ்வாறு, பிள்ளைகளின் அழிவிற்கு பெற்றோர்களே காரணமாவார்கள்...
கன்று குட்டியை நாவால் நக்கியே காயப்படுத்திய பசுவைப் போல்..."
அடுத்ததாக, நகுலனை பார்த்த கிருஷ்ணர்,
 "நகுலா...! கலியுகத்தில் மக்கள் சான்றோர்களின் நற்சொற்களைப் கேளாமல், நாளுக்கு நாள் ஒழுக்கத்தினின்றும், நற்குணத்தினின்றும்,
நன்னெறிகளிலிருந்தும் நீங்குவார்கள்...
யார் நன்மைகளை எடுத்துக் கூறினாலும் அதை அவர்கள் பொருட்படுத்த மாட்டார்கள்...
எந்தவொரு கட்டுப்பாடும் இன்றி செயல்படுவார்கள்...
இத்தகையவர்களை இறைவனால் மட்டுமே தடுத்து நிறுத்தி, நிதானப்படுத்தி நன்னெறியுடன் செயல்படுத்த முடியும்...
மரங்களாலே தடுத்து நிறுத்த முடியாத பெரிய பாறையை... 
தடுத்து நிறுத்திய சிறு செடியைப் போல...!" என்று கூறி முடித்தார் பகவான் கிருஷ்ணர்...🙏
ஆகவே, 
கலியுகத்தில் 
 கவனமுடன் 
 நம் வாழ்வை கழித்திடுவோம்...
நன்னெறியில் 
 வாழ்ந்து... 
பாவங்களிலிருந்து
 நம்மை
 காத்திடுவோம்...
அன்பே சிவம்...
அதை அடைவதே
 நமது தவம்...
இதை உணர்ந்தால் தானே
 நமது வாழ்க்கை சுபம்...🙏
ஆகவே,
உண்மையை நாம் 
 உணர்வோம்...
நன்மையை உலகிற்கு சொல்வோம்

04/09/16, 7:15 PM - natarajan ramu: 🇨🇭MUST CIRCULATE🇨🇭

Recently, one person was admitted to a nursing home at Ahmedabad, due to severe chest pain. He had an earlier attack  in 2014 and was under treatment. The doctors now suggested Angiography. 
  
Upon undergoing Angiography at multi speciality Hospital  Doctors diagnosed multiple blockages for which Angioplasty was ruled out and instead,  suggested 'Bypass Surgery'. 

That evening, he was brought home as  doctor suggested his heart being very weak, bypass could be performed only after 10 - 15 days. 
  
Meanwhile, after discussing the matter with relatives and close friends, fresh  information came from a family friend. 
  
A new treatment known as-"Bio Chemical Angioplasty" has been introduced into the Indian medical theatre. 
  
With this therapy, a patient who has to undergo by-pass need not do so.

Instead, the patient is given about 20 bottles of IV fluids in which certain medicament are injected. The medicine cleans the system and removes all blockages from the heart and the arteries. The number of bottles given may increase depending upon the age-factor and health of the patient. 
Cost per bottle Rs.2000/-

Currently, only a few doctors in India specialise in this field

One of them is DR. Bimal Chhajer MBBS MD Ex Consultant AIIMS

He has a list of patients who had to undergo by-pass from major hospitals; but, instead after undergoing the new treatment, they are absolutely fine and are leading a normal life. 
Doctor's details for your info are:

04/09/16, 7:24 PM - Paiya perrippa: அந்த விவசாயியின் ஜாதகத்தை சோதித்து பார்த்த ஜோதிடருக்கு , உள்ளூர தயக்கம் ! காரணம்... ?

அன்றிரவு எட்டு மணிக்கு அந்த விவசாயிக்கு மரணம் நேரக்கூடிய கண்டம் இருந்தது!
அதை அவரிடம் நேரிடையாக சொல்ல விரும்பாமல்,

'' ஐயா ... எனக்கு நிறைய வேலைகள் உள்ளன ... உங்கள் ஜாதகம் என்னிடமே இருக்கட்டும் ! நாளை காலையில் என்னை வந்து பாருங்கள் !'' என்றார்;

ஜோதிடரின் வீட்டிலிருந்து புறப்பட்ட விவசாயி, தன் கிராமத்தை நோக்கி நடக்க ஆரம்பித்தபோது , மாலை சாய்ந்து இருள் சூழ ஆரம்பித்தது ! அப்போது , லேசாக மழைத்தூறல் ஆரம்பிக்க ...... சற்றைக்கெல்லாம் 
பெருமழை கொட்ட துவங்கியது! மழையில் நனைந்தவாறே, சுற்றுமுற்றும் பார்வையை சுழலவிட்டவரின் கண்களில்...
அந்த பாழடைந்த சிவன் கோயில் தென்பட...... ஓடோடிச்சென்ற அவர், கோயிலின் முன்னே இருந்த மண்டபத்தில் ஒதுங்கினார்; ..

மண்டபத்தில் நின்றவாறே , கோயிலின் பாழடைந்த நிலை கண்டு உள்ளூர வருந்தினார்... 
'தன்னிடம் போதுமான பணம் இருந்தால் அக்கோயிலை புதுப்பிக்கும் வேலையை செய்வேன்' என்று மானசீகமாக நினைத்துக் கொண்டதோடு நில்லாது .....

அக்கோயிலை புதுப்பிப்பதாக மானசீகமாக கற்பனையும் செய்து கொண்டு ....
கோபுரம் ...  ராஜகோபுரம் ...
உட்பிராகாரங்கள் மற்றும் .. மண்டபங்கள் முதலானவற்றை மனதிற்குள் கற்பனையாகவே அமைத்து .... வேதியர்கள் புடைசூழ கும்பாபிஷேகமும் விமரிசையாக நடத்தி ..........  இப்படி தன்னை மறந்து சிந்தனைகளில் ஈடுபட்டிருந்தவரின் பார்வை தற்செயலாக மண்டபத்தின் எதிரே நோக்க .......

அங்கே ஒரு பெரிய கருநாகம் படமெடுத்த நிலையில்... அவரை கொத்த தயாராக இருந்தது !! சூழ்நிலையின் விபரீதத்தை உணர்ந்த அவர் , மறுகணம் அலறியடித்துக் கொண்டு வெளியே ஓடி வரவும் , மண்டபம் ' கிடுகிடுவென்று இடிந்து விழவும் சரியாக இருந்தது !  இப்போது மழையும் நின்று விட்டிருக்க .... விவசாயியும் வீடு போய் சேர்ந்தார்:

பொழுது விடிந்ததும் முதல் வேலையாய் ஜோதிடர் வீட்டுக்கு சென்ற அவரை கண்டு ஜோதிடருக்கு வெகு ஆச்சரியமும் , திகைப்பும் !
' எப்படி இது சாத்தியம் ? நாம் ஜோதிடக்கணக்கில் தவறி விட்டோமோ ' என்று  பலவாறான எண்ண அலைகளுடன் மீண்டும் விவசாயி ஜாதகத்தை அவர் ஆராய ..

அவரது கணக்கு சரியாகவே இருந்தது! பின் , ஒரு உந்துதலின் பேரில் அவர் ஜோதிட நூல்களை துல்லியமாக ஆராய்ந்த அக்கணம் ....

'இப்படிப்பட்ட கண்டத்திலிருந்து ஒருவன் தப்ப வேண்டுமானால் , அவனுக்கு ஒரு சிவன் கோயிலை கட்டி முடித்து , கும்பாபிஷேகமும் செய்த புண்ணியம் இருக்கவேண்டும்'  என்று ஜோதிட நூலில் குறிப்பிட்டிருந்தது !

' ஒரு ஏழைக்கு , சிவன் கோயிலை கட்டி , கும்பாபிஷேகமும் செய்வது என்பது எப்படி சாத்தியம் '  என்று எண்ணியவாறே ஜோதிடம் அறிவித்த அனைத்து விவரங்களையும் அவரிம் அந்த ஜோதிடர் இப்போது எடுத்துரைக்க அவரோ, வெகு இயல்பாக முந்திய நாள் இரவு தனக்கு ஏற்பட்ட அனுபவங்களை அவரிடம் எடுத்துரைத்தார் !!. கேட்டுக் கொண்டிருந்த ஜோதிடருக்கு ஆச்சரியம் கலந்த அதிர்ச்சி !!!!!!!!

#இறைப்பணி_பற்றிய_கற்பனை_கூட_விதியை_வெல்லும்.

09/09/16, 8:03 AM - Paiya perrippa: *Retirement Planning*
 *A case study ✍ elderly couple*

*As we were returning from Goa, we happened to share our bench with an elderly couple* *who had just crossed seventy. Husband has retired from senior level position in Central Government. The wife has retired as steno typist from one of the respected names in private sector after forty years long service.*

*While sharing general topics, inadverdently we touched my favourite topic of retirement planning.*

*Here are some of the gems that I picked up from uncle:*

*1) Do not dream on behalf of your children. They have their own dreams and aspirations. Parents job is only to fund education.*

*2) The generation to generation view of life changes drastically.  Learn to take it cool.*

*3) Do not over invest in real estate. The children are too busy to maintain property which is outside their place of work. This couple in their seventies visits Goa every month to maintain their second home.*

*4) Land purchased by the couple has been encroached with only a third portion of it in their possession. Children do not have inclination to fight it out in court.  Children are highly educated and well placed in life. With their spouses also working, no one is interested in assets owned by parents.*

*5) Cash invested in some form which gives regular interest or is easily encashable is most important than anything else. The uncle gets monthly pension of Rs.35,000 and yet even one monthly pension is delayed, they get jitters.*

*6) Major investments of family are in real estate and Gold. Both they are not able to sell.*

*7) Mediclaim was ignored when the health was perfect. Now both partners had to undergo  sugeries where a total of Rs. 8 Lacs has gone from savings.*

*His parting message*
*¤ My son, Cash is very important. Invest in asset which gives you regular income and easy liquidity. Also take very good care of your health. Good health plus Good Cash is Happy Retirement.*
*Lots of learning from this lovely couple.*

14/09/16, 5:55 AM - Paiya perrippa: This picture taken after the historical win of Narendra Modi became the poster in the Indian Political History. Probably there is no person who hasn’t seen this picture. Apart from Modi and his Mother we also see a lady standing with a plate. Yes, she is Nikunjben, niece of Narendra Modi and daughter of Prahalad Modi, younger brother of our Prime Minister.
In a very unfortunate incident, Nikunjben passed away last week following a prolonged heart problem. The news of her illness reached Modi when he was in G-20 Summit in China. After his return to India he immediately called his brother to enquire about her health, only to hear that she had passed away. His tight schedule did not even permit him to go to her funeral ceremony, but he enquired and spoke to his brother again after the funeral for his niece.
Many people in the government did not know about this incident. But during the Kashmir meeting, many observed that Narendra Modi’s eyes were wet, when asked they found out that his niece had passed away.
Nikunj and her family were not financially strong, they lived in a small rented house and her husband worked in a private company. In order to support her husband Nikunj did tailoring and took tuitions to school children. Inspite of being the niece of Prime Minister himself, not once had she used her position to get favors from any government authority. She had not even told anyone that she was related to Narendra Modi.
In a time where we mostly hear people misusing their position to make money, the way Narendra Modi’s family has kept their identity so low is something we need to appreciate. Even after hearing such sad news, Modi did not take one day holiday to visit her but instead attended back to back summits trying his best to get work done.
There seem no words to describe the commitment, hard work and dedication of Modi towards our country. We only can wholeheartedly pray God to give him more strength and energy and take India to great heights.

14/09/16, 7:54 PM - natarajan ramu: An Awesome story!  Must read!
The story of watermelons by Manohar Parrikar:

"I am from the village of Parra in Goa, hence we are called Parrikars. My village is famous for its watermelons. When I was a child, the farmers would organise a watermelon-eating contest at the end of the harvest season in May. All the kids would be invited to eat as many watermelons as they wanted. Years later, I went to IIT Mumbai to study engineering. I went back to my village after 6.5 years. I went to the market looking for watermelons. They were all gone. The ones that were there were so small. I went to see the farmer who hosted the watermelon-eating contest. His son had taken over. He would host the contest but there was a difference. When the older farmer gave us watermelons to eat he would ask us to spit out the seeds into a bowl. We were told not to bite into the seeds. He was collecting the seeds for his next crop. We were unpaid child labourers, actually. He kept his best watermelons for the contest and he got the best seeds which would yield even bigger watermelons the next year. His son, when he took over, realised that the larger watermelons would fetch more money in the market so he sold the larger ones and kept the smaller ones for the contest. The next year, the watermelons were smaller, the year later even small. In watermelons the generation is one year. In seven years, Parra's best watermelons were finished. In humans, generations change after 25 years. It will take us 200 years to figure what we were doing wrong while educating our children."
Unless we employ our best to train the next generation, this is what can happen to us. We must attract the best into teaching profession. :) :)

15/09/16, 9:14 AM - natarajan ramu: Have you read this before ? Drastic change in taxation methodology suggested to eliminate black money.

Anil Bokil , one of the key member of Arthakranti Sansthan was given time to share to PM Modi. He was given 9min for sharing but Mr Modi heard him for 2 hrs.


Arthakranti Proposal

What is Arthakranti Proposal and who hasgiven the proposal?

“Arthakranti Proposal” has been given by a Pune (Maharashtra) based “Arthakranti Sansthan” which is an Economic Advisory body constituted by a group of Chartered Accountants and Engineers. This funda has been patented by the Sansthan.

Arthakranti Proposal is an effective and guaranteed solution of Black Money Generation, Price rise and Inflation, Corruption, Fiscal Deficit, Unemployment, Ransom, GDP and industrial growth, terrorism and good governance.

What is in the Proposal ?

“Arthakranti Proposal has FIVE point of actions simultaneously.

(1) Scrap all 56 Taxes including income tax excluding import duty.

(2) Recall and scrap high denomination currencies of 1000, 500 and 100 rupees.

(3) All high value transaction to be made only through banking system like cheque, DD, online and electronic.

(4) Fix limit of cash transaction and no taxing on cash transaction.

(5) For Govt. revenue collection introduce single point tax system through banking system – Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) on only Credit Amount

Important Points to note:

(1) As on today total banking transaction is more than 2.7 lakh crores per day say more than 800 lakh crores annually.

(2) Less than 20% transaction is made through banking system as on today and more than 80% transaction made in cash only, which is not traceable.

(3) 78% of Indian population spend less than 20/- rupees daily why they need 1000/- rupee note.

What will happen if All FIFTY SIX Taxes including income tax scrapped :

(1) Salaried people will bring home more money which will increase purchasing power of the family.

(2) All commodities including Petrol, Diesel, FMCG will become cheaper by 35% to 52% .

(3) No question of Tax evasion so no black money generation.

(4) Business sector will get boosted. So self employment.

What will happen if 1000/ 500/ 100 Rupees currency notes recalled and scrapped :

(1) Corruption through cash will stopped 100%.

(2) Black money will be either converted to white or will vanish as billions of 1000/500/100 currency notes hidden in bags without use will become simple pieces of papers.

(3) Unaccounted hidden huge cash is skyrocketing the prices of properties, land, houses, jewellery etc and hard earned money is loosing its value; this trend will stop immediately.

(4) Kidnapping and ransom, “Supari killing” will stop.

(5) Terrorism supported by cash transaction will stop.

(6) Cannot buy high value property in cash showing very less registry prices.

(7) Circulation of “Fake Currency” will stop because fake currency printing for less value notes will not be viable.

What will happen when Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) is implemented :

(1) As on today if BTT is implemented govt can fetch 800 x 2% = 16 lakh crore where as current taxing system is generating less than 14 lakh crore revenue.

(2)When 50% of total transaction will be covered by BTT sizing 2000 to 2500 lakh crores, Govt will need to fix BTT as low as 1% to 0.7% and this will boost again banking transaction many fold.

(3) No separate machinery like income tax department will be needed and tax amount will directly deposited in State/Central/District administration account immediately.

(4) As transaction tax amount will be very less, public will prefer it instead paying huge amount against directly/indirectly FIFTY SIX taxes.

(5) There will be no tax evasion and govt will get huge revenue for development and employment generation.

(6) For any special revenue for special projects, govt can slightly raise BTT say from 1% to 1.2% and this 0.2% increase will generate 4,00,000 crores additional fund.

Effect of if implemented today :

(01)Prices of all things will come down.

(02)Salaried people will get more cash in hand.

(03)Purchasing power of Society will increase.

(04)Demand will boost, so will production and industrialisation and ultimately more employment opportunity for youth.

(05) Surplus revenue to the govt for effective health/ education/ infrastructure/ security/ social works.

(06) Cheaper and easy loans from banks, interest rate will come down.

(07) Tendency of society will changes from scarcity to quantity.

(08) Spare money for political system for clean politics,

(09) Prices of land/ property will come down,

(10) No need to export beef to cover up trade deficit

(11) Sufficient fund for research and development.

(12) Society will be free from “Bad elements”.

A very nice n simple compilation with logical impact. Worth sharing!!

15/09/16, 9:16 AM - natarajan ramu: *CLEAN YOUR KIDNEYS IN Rs. 5.00 OR EVEN LESS...*

Years are passing by and our kidneys are filtering the blood by removing salt and any unwanted bacteria entering our body.
With time salt accumulates in our kidney and it needs to undergo cleaning treatment.

*How are we going to do this...?*
Here is an easy, cheap and simple way to do it.
Take a bunch of Coriander (DHANIYA Leaves) and wash it clean. Cut it in small pieces and put it in a
pot. Pour clean water and boil it for ten minutes and let it cool down. Next filter it and pour it in a clean bottle and keep it in refrigerator to cool.
Drink one glass everyday and you will notice all salt and other accumulated impurities coming out of your kidney while urination. You will be able to notice the difference yourself...!
*DHANIYA/CORIANDER* is known as a best cleaning treatment for kidneys and the best part is it is
natural!

*Please share this information with others and keep your kidneys clean...*

Dont just Read
 👉Do forward to whom you care.👈👍

17/09/16, 8:38 PM - natarajan ramu: Interesingly legend MS Subbulakshmi amma has sung an English song with piano as an accompaniment. This song, composed by Rajaji, was sung at the UN Assembly in 1966. The song was set to music by Handel Manuel, Producer of Western Music at AIR, Madras. The idea of an English song had come from Gen. Cariappa.  MS sang it first on October 21 at the Carnegie Hall, where C.V. Narasimhan presented her as the “First Lady of Carnatic Music.”

Here is the lyric of the English song:

May the Lord forgive our sins
And gather all the nations
Here under this Uniting Roof.

To give up hate and fear
And learn to understand
Here under this Uniting Roof.

They took the risks of war
and dying, wished us take
the better risks of peace
Here under this Uniting Roof.

The God in everyman
is an atom too
of measureless potential.
Let us learn to find it
And explode it into lasting peace
Here under this Uniting Roof.

May the Lord forgive our sins
Inspiring us to peace on Earth

Here under this Uniting Roof.

Amazing video you will see, air traffic around the world for 24 hours, taken from satellite and compressed into one minute video. The yellow dots are airplanes in the sky during 24 hours period. Stay with the video and you will see the light of the day moving from East to West , as the earth spin's on its axis. Also, you will see the flow of aircrafts traffic leaving the North American continent and traveling at night to arrive in UK in the morning. Then you will see the flow changing, leaving UK in the morning and flying to the american continent in the day light. Notice the entire USA and Europe shining with the yellow dots. Europe alone has its local 30,000 flights per day. Similarly observations can be made on aircraft traffic in others parts of the world. Most people aren' t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircrafts through our skies. This visualization is created to highlight the complexity of that work of air traffic controllers. Hats off to engineering.....

19/09/16, 7:54 AM - natarajan ramu: Check ur presence of mind.............Take d test.

relax, clear your mind and begin, what's the 1st answer that comes to ur mind???...........


1. What do you put in a toaster?














Answer:
"bread." If you said "toast," give up now and do something else.. Try not to hurt yourself. If you said bread, go to Question 2





2. Say "silk" five times. Now spell "silk." What do cows drink?











Answer:
Cows drink water. If you said "milk," don't attempt the next question.
Your brain is over -stressed and may even overheat. Content yourself by reading more appropriate literature such as Auto World. However, if you said "water", proceed to question 3...



3. If a red house is made from red bricks and a blue house is made from blue bricks and a pink house is made from pink bricks and a black house is made from black bricks, what is a
green house made from?














Answer:
Greenhouses are made from glass. If you said "green bricks," why are you still reading these?? If you said "glass," go on to Question 4.




4. It's twenty years ago, and a plane crashes from 20,000 feet over Germany (If you will recall, Germany at the time was politically divided into East and West Germany) Where would you bury the survivors? East Germany, West Germany, "no
man's land"?










Answer: You don't bury survivors!!! If you said ANYTHING else, you must stop. If you said, "You don't bury survivors", proceed to the next question.




5. Without using a calculator - You are driving a bus from Mumbai to Pune. In Mumbai , 17 people get on, in Pune , 16 get off. Name the driver.














Answer: Oh, for crying out loud! Don't you remember your own name? It was YOU!!



😊


Try it seriously dont cheat its amazing
A MUST TRY!!!!!!!          ALZHEIMERS'  EYE TEST

(I love this part.. It's absolutely amazing!)   

Count every  "  F  " in the following text:

FINISHED  FILES ARE THE RE
SULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTI
FIC STUDY COMBINED  WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS...  
(SEE  BELOW)


HOW MANY ? 
  
3....4....






WRONG,  THERE ARE  6  --  no joke.
READ IT AGAIN !
Really, go Back and Try to find the  6 F's before you scroll down.


The reasoning behind is  further down.





The brain cannot  process "OF".

Incredible  or what? Go back and look again!!

Anyone who counts  all 6 "F's" on the first go is a genius.

Three  is normal, four is quite rare. 

crazy!!:

20/09/16, 8:44 PM - natarajan ramu: பணத்தை திருடும் புதிய மெஷின் (விழிப்புணர்வு பதிவு) :

சைனாவில் தயாரிக்கப்பட்டு இப்போது இந்தியாவிற்கு இறக்குமதி ஆகியிருக்கும் இந்த பணம் என்னும் மெஷின் பெரிய மால் கடைகள், நகைக்கடைகள், மற்றும் சில ஹோட்டல்களில் உள்ளது.. இதற்கு ஒரு சிறிய ரிமோட் கொடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.. உதாரணத்திற்கு நாம் நகைக்கடையில் 30000 அதாவது 30 ஆயிரம் ரூபாய் நோட்டுக்கள் கொடுக்கிறோம் என்று வைத்துக்கொள்வோம் .. 

அவர்கள் அதை வாங்கி நம் கண்ணெதிரே மிஷினில் போட்டு நமக்கு தெரியாமல் கீழே ரிமோட்டை அமுக்கினால் இரண்டு நோட்கள் காணாமல் போய் 28 நோட்கள் தான் கவுண்டீங் காட்டும்.. நீங்கள் உடனே ஷாக் ஆகி நோட்டுகளை வாங்கி எண்ணினால் 28 நோட்கள் தான் இருக்கும்.. மீண்டும் மீண்டும் எண்ணினாலும் அதே.. 

இதெல்லாம் உங்கள் கண்ணெதிரே நடப்பதால் வேறு வழி இல்லாமல் நீங்கள் இரண்டு ஆயிரம் ரூபாய் நோட்களை கொடுக்க நேரிடும்.. நீங்கள் போன பிறகு அந்த கடைக்காரர் மிஷினை திருப்பி அதற்கு அடியீல் உள்ள அறையை திறப்பார். அதில் காணாமல் போன இரண்டு ஆயிரம் ரூபாய் நோட்டுகள் இருக்கும் அதை அவர் எடுத்து கொள்வார்.. கஷ்டப்பட்டு சம்பாரித்த பணத்தை நாம் எங்கே தொலைத்தோம் என்று நொந்து போய் தேடிக் கொண்டிருப்போம்..

அதுவும் ரிமோட்டில் பல்வேறு எண்ணிக்கையில் நோட்டுக்களை  திருடும் அளவிற்கு ஆப்சன்கள் கொடுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளன.. நீங்கள் கொஞ்சம்  விவரமாக இருந்தால் ஒன்று, இரண்டு நோட்டுகள் பறிபோகும், ஏமாந்தவங்களாக இருந்தால் ஒரே கவுண்டிங்கில் 10 நோட்டுக்கள் மேல் போகலாம்..  

அதனால் படத்தில் கண்டவாறு மெஷின் மாடல்களை பார்த்தால் ரொம்பவே உஷாராக இருங்கள்.. முதலில் நோட்டுகளை உங்கள் கண்முன்னே கையில் ஒருமுறைக்கு, இருமுறை என்ன சொல்லுங்கள் .. பெரும்பலான கடைகளில் மெஷின்கள் உபயோகிப்பதற்கு காரணம் கவுண்டிங் பர்பசை விட கள்ள நோட்டுகளை கண்டுபிடிப்பதற்குதான்.. அதனால் கள்ள நோட்டுகளை கண்டுபிடிப்பதற்காகதான் மெஷினில் போடுகிறோம் என்று கடை முதலாளிகள் சொன்னால் கூட முதலில் நோட்டுகளை கையில் எண்ணி அதன் எண்ணிக்கையை உறுதி செய்து கொள்ளுங்கள்.. 

அதற்கப்புறமும் மெஷினில் போட்டுவிட்டு எண்ணிக்கை குறையுதுனு சொன்னால் மிஷினை திருப்பி ரகசிய அறையில் உள்ள நோட்டுகளை கண்டுபிடிப்பதோடு அல்லாமல் அருகில் உள்ள காவல் நிலையத்தில் புகார் அளியுங்கள்!!!!

Sardarji's Mom's Letter

Dear Banta
Vahe  Guru !
 

I am in a well here and hoping you are in the same well there. I'm  writing this letter slowly, because I know you  cannot read fast. 
 

We  don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in  the newspaper  that most accidents happen 20 miles from home, so we moved  20 miles. 
 

I wont be able to send the address as the last Sardar who  stayed here  took the house numbers with them for their new house so they would not have  to change their address. Hopefully by next week we will be able  to bring  our earlier address plate here, so that our address will remain  same too. 
 

This  place is really nice. It even has a washing machine, situated  right above  the commode. I'm not sure how it works. Last week I put in 3  shirts, pulled  the chain and haven't seen them since. 
 

The  weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice last week. The  first time  it rained for 3 days and second time for 4 days. 
 

The  coat you wanted me to send you, your Aunt said it would be a little  too heavy  to send in the mail with all the metal buttons, so we cut them off  and put  them in the pocket. 
 

Your  father has another job. He has 500 men under him. He is cutting  the grass  at the cemetery. 
 

By  the way I took Bahu to our club's poolside. The manager is  really badmash.  He told her that two-piece swimming suit is not allowed in  this club.  We were confused as to which piece should we remove? 
 

Your  sister had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether it is  a girl  or a boy, so I don't know whether you are an Aunt or  Uncle. 
 

Your  uncle, Jetinder fell in a nearby well. Some men tried to pull him  out, but  he fought them off bravely and drowned. We cremated him and he  burned for  three days. 
 

Your  best friend, Balwinder, is no more. He died trying to fulfill  his father's  last wishes. His father had wished to be buried at sea after  he died.  And your friend died while in the process of digging a grave for  his father. 
 

There  isn't much more news this time. Nothing much has  happened. 
 
P.S:  Beta, I was going to send you some money but by the time I realized,  I had  already sealed off this letter🍂

24/09/16, 8:41 PM - natarajan ramu: Must read.....I bet u all like it

Awesome...... A story in one of the schools in Chennai where admission is considered impossible!!!

To get UKG admission 

The child could not understand why they brought her there..

When we all were standing, the school principal started to converse with the child....yes...in English only! 

This is one of the most memorable interview I have ever witnessed in my life..
Here goes..

"What's your name?"

"Sarithra"

"Good. Tell me something you know"

"I know many things. Tell me what you want...!"

Alas, there is no better point for not getting the admission!

Sarithra's mother was trying to make up the situation but the principal stopped her..

Turning to child, she said.. "Tell any rhyme or story which you know.."

Again,"Which one you want.. Rhyme or Story!?"

"Ok. Plz tell me a story.."

"Do uou want to hear what I studied or what I wrote..!?"

Taken to surprise, she asked "Oh! you write stories...???"

"Why should I not write..?"

Now even I was taken aback But she was impressed with the answer. She ( including us) would have not heard such a story in our life...

Ok, tell me story which you have written-?

Sarithra said "Ravanan kidnapped Sita & took her to Srilanka"

The opening scene failed to impress but still she encouraged the child to continue..

"Rama asked Hanumans help to rescue Sita. Hanuman too agreed to help Rama ..."

"Then?"

"Now, Hanuman called his friend Spider man." No one expected this twist in the story!!

"Why?"

"Because there are lot of mountains between India and Srilanka.. but if we have Spiderman we can go easily with his rope..."

"But Hanuman can fly isn't it.. ?"

"Yes. But he is having Sanjeevi Mountain on one hand so he cannot fly very fast.!"

All is quiet, after a while Sarithra asked "Should I continue or not?.".

"Ok plz continue!"

"Hanuman and Spiderman flew to Srilanka and rescued Sita. Sita said Thanks to both!"

"Why"

"When you are helped you should say Thanks!"

So Sita requested Hanuman to call Hulk..."

All were surprised.She realized our curiosity and said " Now Sita is there, so to take her safely back to Rama she called Hulk"

"What??? "Hanuman can carry Sita right?"

"Yes. But he has Sanjeevi Mountain in one hand and has to hold spider man on the other"

No one could control thier smiles. " So when they all started to India they met my friend Akshay! "

"How come Akshay there now?"

"Because its my story and I can bring any one there!"

The principal didn't get angry but waited for the next twist

Then all started to India and landed at Chennai Velechery bus stop! 

Now I asked,"Why they have landed In Velechery bus stop?

"Because they forgot the way..& Hulk got an idea and called Dora!"

I came to know about Dora only there...!

"Dora came and she took Sita to Velechery Venus Colony...that's all!" 

She finished the story with a smile.. 😀

The principal asks "Why venus Colony...?"

"Because sita lives there & i am Sita!!!"

The principal was impressed and embraced the child. She has been admitted in UKG & was gifted with a Dora doll...

Kids can really amaze... but we clip their wings (creativity) expecting them to do things as we see it right & not from their viewpoint.

Let's give every child freedom to do their own thing & watch their dreams come true...

He was traveling alone! 

Some time later, a Beautiful lady came and sat in the opposite berth! 

IT Engineer was pleasantly Happy!

The lady kept smiling at him!  This made IT Engineer even more Happy!

Then she went and sat next to him! 

IT Engineer was bubbling with Joy! 

She then leant towards him and whispered in his ear " Hand over all your valuables, cash, cards, mobile phone to me 
else I will shout and tell everybody that you are  harassing and misbehaving with me" 

IT Engineer stared blankly at her!

He took out a paper and a pen from his bag and wrote " I  can not hear or speak. You write on this paper whatever you want to say" 


The lady wrote everything what she said earlier and gave it to him! 

IT Engineer took her note, kept it in his pocket! 

He got up and told her in clear tones..."Now shout & scream!!"

Modi’s Biggest Diplomatic Win over Pakistan

Since yesterday there has been lot of emotions running with regard to UriAttack. We saw many people demanding immediate retaliation, to declare war on Pakistan, to curb media, separatists playing in the hands of Pakistan. But not many know the action against Pakistan is being planned since months, it’s not a mere fully fledged war game but a powerful ploy that will finish Pakistan forever.

There is saying “If your plan is for one year plant rice. If your plan is for ten years plant trees. If your plan is for one hundred years educate children ”  But don’t expect any plans on Pakistan to be announced on news channels or social media like the previous government. Yes, Indians are used to debating every small or big issue on news to the level of saturation. But this strategic issues are not the ones to be discussed on media.

You can see the result only. The First WIN is getting Russia cancel the Joint Military Operation with Pakistan in PoK from September 24th to October 7th. And on Indian request Russia will not supply MIG-35 to Pakistan.

Some may feel it’s not big a deal. But unless you know how this will affect Pakistan you cannot analyse the impact. Russia is the second most powerful country in terms of military. There support to our enemy would have posed serious threat in dealing with Pakistan which now has been averted.

How India Will Play The Game…

Presently the countries which are supporting India are US, UK, Russia, France, Japan, Vietnam, Israel, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. YES Saudi is supporting India (Now we understand what Modi was doing in Saudi).  These countries are completely against Pakistan and China. So India has gained the support of most powerful countries of the world and have promised to isolate Pakistan internationally.

There has been a pact made by India, Iran and Afghanistan on the Chahabar Port which is situated in the Persian Gulf, this was specifically done to bypass all trade and transport which goes through Pakistan. Although the project was started in 2003 during Vajpayee government, to tackle the Pakistan-China joint venture Gwadar port situated just 72km from Chahabar port the UPA showed no interest to take this forward. This pact is costed Pakistan huge economic loss.

Afghanistan has promised India to provide BASE to military operation if India strikes WAR against Pakistan. So we can engulf Pakistan from all sides.

If at all China supports Pakistan against India, it will be the biggest mistake as Japan, Vietnam and Saudi will stand by India. And definitely US will protest against China as they are looking to curb China’s growth in East-Asia.

Indian media may not have shown this, but Pakistani strategists and policy makers have said Modi will Destroy Pakistan without War!  And yes it is true, Modi is not for war, but he will make Pakistan Bleed without making Noise! There may be retaliations and surgical strikes but not WAR. Once Pakistan is economically and financially weak, WAR will be far more risk to handle, which is when India plans to take back what belongs to us!

War is no game, any country’s economy will be hit during war, and same people will blame Modi if prices go up after War!

Remember Modi is not looking for temporary gain and transient solution, but for a PERMANENT SOLUTION!

02/10/16, 11:08 AM - Pornima Akka: This is smart one, worth forwarding endlessly.

An indigenious example of speech and politics occurred recently in the United Nations Assembly that made the world community smile.

A representative from India began:

"Before beginning my speech, I want to tell you a very very old story about Rishi Kashyap of Kashmir, after whom Kashmir is named. 

When he found a beautiful lake, he thought- "What a good opportunity to have a bath",

He removed his clothes, put them aside on the rock and entered the water.

When he got out and wanted to dress, his clothes had vanished.
A Pakistani had stolen them! 

'The Pakistani representative in the Assembly jumped up furiously and shouted, "what r u talking about? 
The Pakistanis weren't there then." 

Indian representative smiled and said,

"And now that we have made that clear, I'll begin my speech. 

"And they (Pakistan) say Kashmir 
belongs to them". 

Everybody laughed.

Being an Indian, I simply love this msg.. 

Even at the cost of repeating it!!💪👌👍

THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
Gandhi, who was an ordinary person, was able to achieve greatness and world renown, because of the lessons in good behavior he learnt from his mother. The mother observed a vow: she would take her food only after the cuckoo sang in the morning. Once when Gandhi was a boy, the mother was waiting for a long time to hear the call of the cuckoo. Observing this, Gandhi went out of the house, imitated the call of the cuckoo and came in and told his mother that the cuckoo had sung and that she could take her food. The mother, who saw through her son's trickery, slapped him on the cheek and said, "You wicked fellow! What sin must I have committed to bear a son like you?" She felt very sad. Her grief touched the heart of Gandhi. From that moment Gandhi took a firm resolve never to utter a lie again. (Divine Discourse, 6 May 1992)

07/10/16, 6:23 PM - Pornima Akka: 526 Km High In The Sky, Here's How ISRO Satellites Gave India The Precision To Perform Surgical Strikes On Pak Terror.                                   
                                                            By Kunal Anand.                            

While Pakistan’s official line scoffs at the very idea of surgical strikes, India has not only announced upcoming “clinching evidence” to confirm our bold cross-LoC foray, but also credited ISRO’s flock of metallic birds in the sky. 

India is fast developing a huge capability called 'C4ISR' or 'command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance'.

Our Aerospace Command is manned by experts who understand 'surgical strikes'.
Along with tracking militant movements in real time, ISRO’s world-class capabilities allow India to give out accurate navigation signals. This is a herculean task, managed by ISRO’s 17,000 strong work force.

In the coming years, India's space assets will play a much bigger role for managing border conflicts.

Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO, says, "The Indian space agency will not be found lacking in helping secure India's national interests now and in future." 

Our satellite army

Today, India has 33 satellites in orbit around the earth and one in the Martian orbit. These include 12 communications satellites; 7 navigation satellites; 10 earth observation satellites and 4 weather monitoring satellites. This is one of the largest constellation of satellites in the Asia-Pacific region. Each bird is tailor-made for a specific purpose and each when needed helps protects India's supreme national interests. 

For this week’s surgical strike, it was the recently launched Cartosat 2-series satellite which deserves credit. From its 526-km perch, this bird can peer at every object in Pakistan and can easily count the number of cars parked in the grand mansion of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It rotates across the Earth every 1.5 hours, scanning with a 0.65-m resolution that allows India to count each and every tank, truck and fighter aircraft parked anywhere in Pakistan or across the world. 

"The Cartosat 2 series has a unique capability of capturing a 1-minute video, which despite its enormous speed of 37 km a second, is able to focus at a single point for a minute," Kumar said. India is already working on satellites with a 25 cm resolution. 

In contrast, Pakistan has binoculars, literally!

Pakistan’s lack of a space program allows no satellite launches. Nair says "India invested heavily in space imaging technology and is now reaping the benefits."  Some of our satellites have day and night viewing capabilities (RISAT-1 and RISAT-2), and they can even see through cloud cover. 

India's enemies should have no doubts that very soon these swadeshi GPS signals will be leading its commandos into the very den of masterminds who control the terrorists.

While understandably much of the resources are focused on land since India has hostile neighbours both on its western and eastern fronts.

ISRO has not forgotten the deep blue oceans that surround India and they need to be protected as well. On a specific demand by the Indian Navy, the Indian space scientists have already deployed a satellite the Navy calls 'Rukmini'.

This is a dedicated communications satellite which helps the Indian Navy talk to its ships when they are beyond the visual range, in a secure fashion.  In coming years, ISRO will also deliver a dedicated satellite made for the Indian Air Force.

11/10/16, 8:29 PM - natarajan ramu: நோய்கள் என்றால் என்ன? கண்டிப்பாக அனைவரும் முழுமையாக படித்துவிட்டு பகிரவும்........
நமது உடலில் இயற்கையாகவே 3 சக்திகள் உள்ளன.
இயங்கு சக்தி. -32 %
செரிமானசக்தி- 32 %
நோய் எதிர்ப்பு சக்தி - 36 %

காய்ச்சல் வரும்போது சாப்பிடாமல் இருந்தால், அந்த செரிமான சக்தியான 32% ..நோய் எதிர்ப்பு சக்தியுடன் சேர்ந்து 32+36 % =68%  ஆக மாறி விடும்.... 
மேலும் நாம் ஓய்விலிருந்தால் இயங்கு சக்தியின் அளவான 32%...நோய் எதிர்ப்பு சக்தியுடன் சேர்ந்து 100 %
ஆக மாறி காய்ச்சல் விரைவில் குணமாகி விடும்.

இப்போ சொலுங்க சாதாரண காய்ச்சலுக்கெல்லாம் மருந்து மாத்திரைகள்ஆண்டிபயாடிக் எல்லாம் வேணுமா?

நமது உடலில் தேங்கும் கழிவுகள் மற்றும் கிருமிகளை நமது உடலே அழித்துவிடும் அல்லது வெளியேற்றிவிடும். இந்த செயல்முறையின் போது (Process)நமது உடலில் ஏற்படும் அசௌகரியங்களை (Inconvenience) நாம் நோய்கள் என்கிறோம்.

எதனால் சுவாசப் பாதையில் நோய்கள் ஏற்படுகின்றன?
நமது சுவாசப் பாதையில் இருக்கின்ற தூசிகளை /கிருமிகளை தும்மல் மூலமாக நமது உடல் வெளியேற்றும். அச் செயல்முறை நிகழும்போது
நமக்கு அசௌகரியமாக இருக்கும் என்பது உண்மையே. அவ்வாறு வெளியேற்றினால் தான் நமது
சுவாசப் பாதையை நமது உடலால் சுத்தமாக வைத்துக்கொள்ள முடியும்.இதன்மூலம் நமது உடலுக்கு
பிராணவாயு கிடைப்பதில் எந்த தங்கு தடையும் இருக்காது.இவ்வாறு உடல் தனக்கு தானே செய்துகொள்கின்ற இயற்கை பராமரிப்பை நாம் வியாதி  அல்லது நோய்கள் என புரிந்துக் கொள்ளும்போது,
ஏதாவது மருந்துக்களை உட்கொண்டு தும்மலை உண்டுபண்ணும் சுரப்பியை வேலை செய்ய விடாமல்
தடுத்துவிடுகிறோம்.

இவ்வாறு தடுக்கும்போது, நிறைய தூசிகள் /கிருமிகள் நம் சுவாசப்பாதையில்தங்கிவிடுகிறது.இந்த சூழ்நிலையில் நமது உடலில் சளி (Sinus) என்னும் சுரப்பி,நிணநீர் (Lympathic Fluid) மூலம் நமது சுவாசப்பாதையில் தேங்கிய கழிவுகள் மற்றும் கிருமிகளை வெளியேற்றும் வேலையில்ஈடுபடும். இந்த
செயல்முறையின் போதுதான் நமக்கு மூக்கு ஒழுகுதல் (Running Nose)ஏற்படும். இதையும் வியாதி என
புரிந்துகொள்ளும் நாம் அவற்றை தடுக்க மருந்துக்களை
உட்கொள்கிறோம்.இதனால் தான் மூக்கடைப்பு
ஏற்பட்டு கழிவுகள் மற்றும் கிருமிகளை வெளியேற்ற சுரந்த நிணநீர் (Lympathic Fluid) நமது முகத்திற்குள்
தேங்குகிறது.இவற்றை தான் நமது உடல் கண்ணீர்
மூலமும் வெளியேற்றும். இந்த நீரைத்தான் பலர் கண்களில் நீர்தானாகவே வடிகிறது என கூறுவார்கள்.இதையும் வியாதி எனக் கருதி அதையும் தடுக்கவும் மருந்துக்களை உட்கொள்கிறோம்.

பல காலமாக தேங்கிய இந்த நீரானது திட வடிவமாக (Solid) மாறுகிறது.இதைத் தான் நாம் சைனஸ் கட்டிகள் Sinusitis (Sinus Infection) என்று அழைக்கிறோம்.
இந்த கட்டிகளை கரைக்க / எரிக்க நமது உடலானது காய்ச்சல் செயல்முறையை நிகழ்த்தும். நாம்
காய்ச்சலையும் வியாதி எனக் கருதி அதையும் தடுக்கவும்
மருந்துக்களை உட்கொள்கிறோம் என்பதை புரிந்துக்
கொள்ளுங்கள்.

நமது சுவாசப்பாதையில் தேங்கிய கழிவுகளை நிணநீர் (Lympathic Fluid) மூலம் வெளியேற்றமுடியாதபோது நமது உடல் சளியின் (Mucus) மூலம் வெளியேற்ற முயற்சி செய்யும். இந்த சளியானது நமது நுரையீரல் மற்றும் சுவாசப்பாதையில் உள்ள கழிவுகளை அதனோடு சேர்த்துக் கொண்டு நமது மூக்கின் மூலம் வெளியேறிவிடும். இந்த சளியையும் நாம் வியாதி எனக் கருதி மருந்துக்களை உட்கொண்டு தடுத்துவிடுகிறோம். அந்த மருந்துகள் சளியை கட்டியாக மாற்றி நமது தொண்டையில் படியச்செய்யும்.அவ்வாறு படியும் கழிவுகள் தான் நமக்கு வறட்டு இருமல் மற்றும்
குறட்டை ஏற்பட அடிப்படை காரணங்கள்.

வறட்டு இருமலுக்கு நாம் சிரப் (Syrup) வடிவில் மருந்துக்களை உட்கொள்ளுவோம். அப்போது நமது
தொண்டையில் படிந்த காய்ந்த சளியானது கொஞ்சம் கொஞ்சமாக கரைந்து நமது நுரையீரலில் (Lungs)
படிந்துவிடும். இவ்வாறு நமது நுரையீரலின் சிற்றறைகள்
அடைபடும்போது நமது உடலுக்கு தேவையான காற்றோட்டம் தடைபடும்.இந்த நிலையை தான்
மூச்சிறைப்பு (Short Breath / Wheezing) என்று அழைக்கிறோம்.இதுவே பெருவாரியான
சிற்றறைகளில் அடைபடும்போது நமது உடலுக்கு
தேவையான காற்றோட்டம் மிகக் குறைந்த அளவே இருக்கும். அப்போது இந்த மூச்சிறைப்பு அடிக்கடி ஏற்படும். இந்த நிலையை தான் நாம் ஆஸ்துமா (Asthma) என்கிறோம்.

பொதுவாக நாம் ஓடும்போது நம் உடலுக்கு நிறைய பிராணவாயு தேவைப்படும். அப்போது நம் சுவாசம் முழுமையாக இல்லாமல் வேகமாக இருக்கும். இந்த
நிலையில் குறைவான நேரத்தில் அதிக மூச்சுக் காற்றை
சுவாசிப்போம் அது தான் மூச்சிறைப்பு. நாம்
அமர்ந்துகொண்டு இருக்கும்போது உடலுக்கு அதிகமாக காற்றோட்டம் தேவைப்படும் நேரங்களில்
குறைவான சிற்றறைகள் மட்டுமேதிறந்திருக்கும் பட்சத்தில் இத்தகையதொரு நிகழ்வு ஏற்படும்.
பெரும்பகுதியான சிற்றறைகள் கழிவுகளால் மூடப்பட்டதே இதற்கு அடிப்படை காரணம். இதை தான்

"கழிவுகளின் தேக்கம் வியாதி;
கழிவுகளின் வெளியேற்றல் குணம்"

என்று கூறுகிறோம். இப்போதும் ஒருவருக்கு ஏன்
ஆஸ்துமா (Asthma) நிலை ஏற்பட்டுள்ளது என்பதை அறியாமல் ஸ்டீராய்டு (Steroid) மருந்துக்களை கொண்டு
இன்ஹேலர் (Inhaler) மற்றும் நேபுளேசர் (Nebulizer) வடிவில் தற்காலிக நிவாரணம் பெறுகிறோம். பல காலமாக தேங்கிய இத்தகைய கழிவுகள்
திட வடிவம் (Solid State) பெறுகிறது.இப்போதும் காய்ச்சல் மூலம் இவற்றை கரைக்க நமது உடலானது முயற்சி
செய்யும், நாம் இந்த முறையும் காய்ச்சலை வியாதி எனக் கருதி.மருத்துகளை உட்கொண்டு அவற்றை
தடுத்துவிடுகிறோம்.

பின்னர் தேங்கிய திடக் கழிவுகளுக்கு காசநோய்
(T.B Tuberculosis) என பெயர் சூட்டுகிறோம். பின்னர். இதற்கும் நாம் மருந்துக்களை உட்கொள்கிறோம். அந்த திடக் கழிவுகளை கரைக்க முயற்சிமேற்கொள்ளும்போது வலி ஏற்படும். நமது நுரையீரலில் வலி ஏற்படுகிறது என்று பரிசோதனை மேற்கொள்வோம். அப்போது பயாஸ்பி (Biospy)எடுத்து புற்றுநோயா (Cancer) என
சோதிப்பார்கள். Biospy என்றால் அந்த திடக்கழிவில் இருந்து மாதிரி (Sample) எடுப்பார்கள். அந்த
மாதிரியில் ரத்த ஓட்டம் இருக்கிறதா என சரிபார்ப்பார்கள்.

கழிவின் தேக்கத்தில், எங்குஇருந்து ரத்த ஓட்டம் வரும்? எனவே இதை புற்றுநோய் கட்டி என்று கூறிவிடுவர்.
இது தான் நுரையீரல் புற்றுநோய்(Lungs Cancer) என்று அழைகப்படுகிறது.

எனவே நமது உடலின் அடிப்படை இயக்கத்தை புரிந்துகொள்வதே ஆரோக்கிய வாழ்வின் அடித்தளம்!
"நம் கையில் இருக்கும் ஒரு பொருளை உலகில் வேறு
எங்குதேடினாலும் கிடைக்காது" ஏனென்றால் அந்த பொருள் இருக்கும் இடத்தை விட்டுவிட்டு இல்லாத
இடத்தில் தேடுகிறோம். இவ்வாறாக இன்றைய தினத்தில் நாம் நமது ஆரோக்கியத்தை மருத்துவமனைகளில்
தேடுகிறோம்.

நம் சுவாச பாதையில் தேங்கும் கழிவுகளை நம் உடம்பானது எவ்வாறு வெளியேற்றும்?

# தும்மல்,
# மூக்கு ஒழுகுதல்,
# சளி,
# இருமல்
# காய்ச்சல் மூலமாக
வெளியேற்றும்.

இவற்றை நாம் வியாதி என கருதி அதை தடுக்க முயற்சிக்கும் போதுதான் இந்த கழிவுகள் தேங்கி
இருக்கும் இடத்திலேயே நமது உடலால் கட்டியாக்கப்படும். பிறகுநமது உடலின் எதிர்ப்புசக்தி
அதிகரிக்கும்போது காய்ச்சல் என்கிற செயல்முறையின் மூலம் வெப்பத்தை அதிகப்படுத்தி அந்த கட்டிகளை மற்றும் நமது உடலில் தேங்கிய இதர கழிவுகளையும் எரித்துவிடும். காய்ச்சலை ஏற்படுத்த போதுமான
சக்தி இல்லாதபோது நமது உடலின் எஞ்சிய சக்தியை கொண்டு கழிவுகளை வெளியேற்ற முயற்சிக்கும்போது அந்த இடத்தில் வலி ஏற்படும். சிலநேரம் நமது எதிர்ப்பு சக்தி போதுமான அளவில் இல்லையென்றால் நமது உடலின் இயக்க சக்தி தேவைப்படும். அப்போதுதான்
தலைவலி ஏற்படும். தலைவலி ஏற்பட்டால் நம்மால் எந்த வேலையும் செய்ய இயலாமல் ஓய்வு எடுப்போம்.
அதற்குதான் தலைவலி ஏற்படுகிறது.

யாரெல்லாம் தலைவலி வந்தால் மருந்துகளின்றி ஓய்வு
எடுக்கிறார்களோ அவர்களுக்கு ஒருபோதும் புற்றுநோய்
வருவதில்லை.யாரெல்லாம் காய்ச்சலுக்கு
மருந்துகளின்றி மற்றும் பசிக்கவில்லை என
உணவின்றி ஓய்வு மட்டுமே எடுக்கிறார்களோ அவர்களுக்கு Typoid,Jaundice, Chicken Guniya, Coma
(விபத்துக்களால் ஏற்ப்படும் Coma),புற்றுநோய் (Cancer), ரத்த புற்றுநோய் (Blood Cancer) போன்ற  எந்த தொந்தரவுகள் ஏற்படுவதில்லை.

இவ்வாறு நமது உடலின் கழிவு வெளியேற்றத்துக்கு நாமே தடையாக இருந்துவிட்டு வியாதிகள்
பெருகிவிட்டது என கூறுகிறோம்.நமது உடலின் அடிப்படையை கற்றுக்கொண்டு மருந்துகளின்றி
ஆரோக்கியமாக வாழ்வோம்.

உங்கள் ஆரோக்கியத்தில் அக்கறையுடன்.......

14/10/16, 12:44 PM - Paiya perrippa: பெருந்தலைவர் காமராஜர், முதல்வராக
இருந்த போது,  சென்னை தாம்பரம்
குடிசைவாசிகளுக்கு  பட்டா  வேண்டும்
என்று ஜீவா போராடினார்.

அப்போது,  தாம்பரத்தில் ஓர்
ஆரம்பப்பள்ளியை திறந்து வைக்கச் சென்றார் காமராஜர்.
போகும் வழியில் தான் ஜீவாவின் வீடு இருந்தது.

அந்தப் பள்ளிக்கு அடிக்கல் நாட்டியவர்
ஜீவா என்பதால், அவரையும் அழைத்துச்
செல்வது தான் சரியாக இருக்கும்
என்று நினைத்து,
காரை ஜீவாவின் வீட்டுக்கு விடச்
சொன்னார்.

ஒழுகும் கூரை வீடு ஒன்றில் குடியிருந்தார் ஜீவா.

திடீரென தன்னுடைய
வீட்டுக்கு காமராஜர்
வந்ததைக் கண்டு ஆச்சர்யப்பட்டு "என்ன காமராஜ்"
என்று கேட்டார்" ஜீவா.
"என்ன நீங்க இந்த வீட்டுல இருக்கீங்க..?"
என்று கேட்டு  ஆதங்கப்பட்டார் காமராஜர்.
உடனே ஜீவா, 
"நான் மட்டுமா..?
இங்கே இருக்கிற
எல்லோரையும் போலத்தான் நானும்
இருக்கேன், என்று சர்வ சாதாரணமாக சொன்னார்.

காமராஜரை, 
உட்கார வைக்க,
ஒரு நாற்காலி கூட
இல்லாததால், இருவரும், நின்று கொண்டே பேசினார்கள்.

"நீ அடிக்கல் நாட்டிய,
 பள்ளிக் கூடத்தைத் திறக்கணும்.
அதான் உன்னையும் கூப்பிட்டுப் போக
வந்தேன்"
என்றார் காமராஜர்.

"காமராஜ்,
நீ முதலமைச்சர், 
நீ திறந்தா போதும்"
என்று ஜீவா மறுக்க,
"அட... ஆரம்பிச்ச
 நீ இல்லாம, 
நான் எப்படிப் போக,
கிளம்பு போகலாம்" என்று அழைத்தார்,  காமராஜர்,

"அப்படின்னா,
 நீ முன்னால போ. நான் அரை மணி நேரத்துல வந்துடுறேன் "
என்று அனுப்பி வைத்தார்.
"கண்டிப்பாக வரணும்" 
என்றார் காமராஜர்.

விழாவுக்கு, அரை மணிக்கு மேல்
தாமதமாகவே வந்தார் ஜீவா.

"என்ன ஜீவா, இப்படி லேட் பண்ணிட்டியே...? "
என்று காமராஜர் உரிமையுடன்
கடிந்து கொண்டார்.

உடனே ஜீவா, "நல்ல
வேட்டி ஒண்ணுதாம்பா இருக்கு.
அதை உடனே துவைச்சு,
காய வைச்சு,
கட்டிட்டு வர்றேன். அதான் தாமதம்.
தப்பா நினைச்சுக்காதே"... என்றார்.
உடனே கண் கலங்கி விட்டார் காமராஜர்.

விழா நல்ல படியாக முடிந்தது. ஆனால்
ஜீவாவின் வறுமை,  காமராஜரை மிகவும் வாட்டியது.
அதனால் ஜீவாவுக்கு தெரியாமல், அவரது கம்யூனிஸ்ட் நண்பர்களை அழைத்துப் பேசினார்.
"ஜீவாவுக்கு வீடு கொடுத்தா போக
மாட்டான்.
காரு கொடுத்தாலும் வாங்க மாட்டான்.
ஆனா,
அவனைப் போல தியாகிகள் எல்லாம்
இத்தனை கஷ்டப் படக்கூடாது என்ன
செய்யலாம்"....? என்றார்.
கூட்டத்தில் இருந்த ஒருவர், 
"ஜீவாவின்
மனைவி படித்தவர். அதனால்
அவருக்கு ஏதாவது பள்ளியில் அரசு வேலை கொடுத்தா, அந்த குடும்பம்
நிம்மதியாக இருக்கும்" என்றார்.

உடனே காமராஜர், "ரொம்ப நல்ல யோசனை.

ஆனா,

நான் கொடுத்தா,  அவன்
பொண்டாட்டியை வேலை செய்ய விட
மாட்டான்.

அதனால நீங்களா ஜீவா மனைவியிடம்
பேசி, 

"வீட்டுக்குப் பக்கத்துல
பள்ளிக்கூடத்துல
ஒரு வேலை காலியாக இருக்குன்னு சொல்லி மனு போடச் சொல்லுங்க.

உடனே,  
நான் வேலை 
போட்டுத் தர்றேன்...

ஆனா, 
இந்த விஷயம் 
வேறு யாருக்கும்
தெரியக்கூடாது

அவன் முரடன், 
உடனே வேலையை 
விட வைச்சுடுவான் 

என்று சொல்லி அனுப்பி வைத்தார்.

அதன்படியே 
ஜீவாவுக்குத்
தெரியாமல், 
அவருடைய
மனைவிக்கு 
அரசு வேலை 
கொடுத்தார்
காமராஜர்.

அதற்குப் 
பின்னரே 
ஜீவாவின்
வாழ்க்கையில்
வறுமை ஒழிந்தது.

காமராஜர், ஜீவா 
இருவருடைய நட்பும்
வார்த்தைகளால் 
வடிக்க முடியாதது.

நோய் வாய்ப்பட்டு 
சென்னை அரசு பொது 
மருத்துவமனையில்
சேர்க்கப்பட்டார் ஜீவா.

தனக்கு முடிவு வந்து விட்டதைத் தெரிந்து கொண்டவர்,
கடைசியாக உதிர்த்த வார்த்தைகள்... "காமராஜருக்கு போன் பண்ணுங்கள்"...
என்பது தான்.

இனி எங்கே 
காணமுடியும்..?

இது போன்ற
தலைவர்களை.

அடித்தட்டு 
மக்களோடு மக்களாக, 

வறுமையை உணர்ந்த, 
பகிர்ந்த தலைவர்கள்,

கர்மவீரர்  
காமராஜர், 
ஜீவா,
கக்கன்
போன்ற தலைவர்கள்.

இதை பகிரலாம் 
என்று நினைத்தால்,

செய்யலாமே... !! 
நண்பர்களே....!!

இது மிக நீளமான , மிகவும் பயனுள்ள பதிவு

அனைவரும் அலோபதி மயக்கத்தில் முழ்கி இருக்கும் இந்த நாட்டில், நம் மரபு மருத்துவத்தை தேடி வந்த உங்கள் அனைவருக்கும் என் வணக்கத்தை தெரிவித்து கொள்கிறேன்.

இன்று நாம் அனைவரும் கூடியிருப்பது சர்க்கரை நோய் என்று சொல்லப்படும் நீரிழிவு பிரச்சனையை பற்றி முழுமையாக தெரிந்து கொள்ளவே.

முதலில் நம் உடல் எதனால் உருவானது என்று பார்போம்.

நமது உடல் பல லட்சம் கோடிக்கனக்கான செல்களால் ஆனது. ஒவ்வொறு செல்களுக்கும் அறிவு இருக்கிறது. இதன் முக்கிய வேலை நாம் உண்ணும் உணவில் உள்ள சத்துக்களை உட்கிரகித்து, கழிவுகளை  வெளியேற்றவது. உட்கிரகித்தல், வெளியேற்றுதல் இதன் முக்கிய வேலை.

உதாரணத்திற்கு ஒரு மண் பொம்மையை காட்டி, தலையை சுட்டிக்காட்டி இது என்ன என்று கேட்டால், தலை என்பீர்கள். கால்களை சுட்டிக்காட்டி இது என்ன என்று கேட்டால், கால் என்பீர்கள். இந்த இரண்டு பகுதியையும் கையால் நசுக்கி பொடித்தால் அங்கு என்ன இருக்கும் ?...... எண்ணில் அடங்கா சிறு, சிறு மண் துகள்கள் மட்டுமே இருக்கும் அல்லவா.

இது போல் தான் நம் உடலும் உச்சந்தலை முதல் உள்ளங்கால் வரை பல லட்சம் கோடிக்கணக்கான செல்களால் ஆனது.

இப்பொழுது உடல் எப்படி இயங்குகிறது என்று பார்ப்போம்.

பொதுவாக ஒரு பொருள் இயங்க வேண்டும் என்றால் என்ன வேண்டும் ?..... ம் சொல்லுங்க. ஏதாவது ஒரு எரிபொருள் வேண்டும் அல்லவா.

உதாரணத்திற்கு வாகனங்கள் இயங்க வேண்டும் என்றால், பெட்ரோல் என்கிற எரிப்பொருள் வேண்டும். மின் சாதனம் இயங்க வேண்டும் என்றால் ?... மின்சாரம் வேண்டும்.

இது போல் நமது உடல் இயங்க வேண்டும் என்றால் என்ன வேண்டும் ? நமது உடலுக்கு எது எரிபொருள் ? உணவு வேண்டும்ங்க. சரி அந்த உணவு செரிமானத்தின் கடைசியில் என்ன வாக மாறுகிறது ? நாம் உண்ணும் மாவுச்சத்து அனைத்தும் சர்க்கரையாக மாறுகிறது. சர்க்கரை என்பது நாம் பயன்படுத்தும் இனிப்பல்ல இது ஒரு சத்துப்பொருள்.

நாம் உண்ணும் உணவில் இருந்து கிடைக்கும் இந்த சர்க்கரை எனும் சத்துப்பொருள் செல்கள் உட்கிரகித்து, எரித்து வெப்ப சக்தி வழங்குகிறது.

இந்த வெப்ப சக்தியால் தான் நாம் இயங்குகிறோம். 

இப்ப சொல்லுங்க நாம் இயங்குவதற்கு என்ன வேண்டும் ?...... சர்க்கரை எனும் சத்துப்பொருள் வேணுமுங்க.  சரியா சொன்னிங்க.

ஒரு பெரியவர் படுத்த படுக்கையாக இருக்கிறார் என்று வைத்துக்கொள்வோம். அவர் உடலை தொட்டுப்பார்த்தால் எப்படி இருக்கும் ?... உடல் சூடாக இருக்கும். அடுத்தநாள் இயற்கை எயதி விட்டார், இப்பொழுது உடலை தொட்டுப்பார்த்தால் எப்படி இருக்கும்?... உடல் ஐஸ் போல் இருக்கும்.

உயிரோடு இருக்கும் போது உடலில் என்ன இருந்தது ?... வெப்பம் இருந்தது. உயிர் இல்லாத போது உடலில் என்ன இல்லை ?... வெப்பம் இல்லை.

இப்பொழுது சொல்லுங்க உயிரோடு இருக்க வேண்டும் என்றால் என்ன வேண்டும் ?.... வெப்பம் வேணுமுங்கோ. வெப்பம் சக்தி எப்படி நமக்கு கிடைக்கிறது ?... உணவில் உள்ள சர்க்கரை (மாவுச்சத்து) செல்களால் எரிக்கப்பட்டு வெப்ப சத்தி கிடைக்குதுங்க.

இப்ப சொல்லுங்க, நாம உயிரோட இருக்கனும் நா என்ன வேண்டும் ?... சர்க்கரை வேணும் ங்க. சரியா சென்னிங்க. இவருக்கு எல்லோரும் கை தட்டுங்க.

பாருங்கள் மக்களே. நாம் உயிரோடு இருக்க தேவைப்படும் ஒரு அதிஅவசிய சர்க்கரை என்னும் சத்துப்பொருளால் நமக்கு நோய் ஏற்படுகிறது என்கிறார்களே, இதுவே இவர்களின் உச்சகட்ட கொடூர மனப்பான்மையை வெளிப்படுத்துகிறது.

இது வரைக்கும் உடல் எதனால் ஆனது., எப்படி இயங்குகிறதென்று பார்தோம்.

இப்பொழுது செரிமானத்தை பற்றி பார்போம்.

நாம் உண்ணும் உணவு வாயில் உமிழ் நீருடன் கலந்தவுடன் செரிமானம் ஆக துவங்கிவிடுகிறது, பின் வயிற்றில் அமிலத்துடன் கலந்து செரிக்கப்பட்டு, சிறுகுடலுக்கு செல்கிறது இங்கு பித்த பையில் இருந்து வரும் பித்த நீரால் செரிக்கப்படுகிறது. பின் இந்த செரிக்கப்பட்ட உணவுக்கூழில்  உள்ள சத்துக்கள் சிறுகுடலின் கடைசிப்பகுதியில் இரத்ததில் கலக்கிறது. பின் கழிவுகள் பொருங்குடலுக்கு சென்று வெளியேற்றப்படுகிறது.

வாய், வயிறு, சிறுகுடலில் செரிமானம் சரியாக நடந்தால், இரத்தத்தில் கலந்த சத்துப்பொருட்கள் தரமான சத்துப்பொருட்களாக இருக்கும். செரிமானம் சரி இல்லை என்றால். சத்துப்பொருட்கள் தரமற்றவையாக இருக்கும்.

பொதுவாகவே நமது உடலுக்கு நன்மையை ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளும் திறனும். தீமையை வெளியேற்றும் திறனும் இயல்பாவே இருக்கிறது.

எப்படி என்று கேட்கிறீர்களா ? இதோ செயல் முறை விளக்கம்.

இப்பொழுது நீங்கள் பசி யோடு இருக்கிறீர்கள் என்று வைத்துக்கொள்வோம். நான் உங்களுக்கு மிகவும் பிடித்த உணவை உங்கள் கண் முன்னே கொண்டு வந்து காட்டிச்செல்கிறேன். இப்பொழுது வாயில் என்ன மாற்றம் நிகழும் ?.... ஐய்யா எச்சில் ஊறுகிறது. ம் சரி.
அதே உணவை உங்கள் கண் முன்னே கீழே போட்டு மிதித்துவிட்டேன், அதை அப்படியே தட்டில் எடுத்து வைத்து மீண்டும் உங்கள் அருகில் கொண்டு வந்து காட்டிச்செல்கிறேன். இப்பொழுது எப்படி இருக்கும் ? உமிழ் நீர் சுரக்குமா ?.... சுரக்கவில்லைங்க, கொமட்டீட்டு தான் வருகிறது.

இவ்வளவுதாங்க விடையமே. நல்லதிற்கு நமது உடல் உமிழ் நீர் சுரந்து ஏற்றுக்கொள்கிறது. கெட்டதற்கு உமிழ் நீர் சுரக்காமல் ஏற்க மறுக்கிறது.

நமது உடலில் பல சுரபு உறுப்புகள் இருக்கின்றன. உமிழ் நீர் சுரபிகள், தைய்ராய்டு, தைமஸ், கணையம் போன்ற பல சுரப்புறுப்புக்கள் இருக்கிறது.

இதே போல் தான் கணையமும். இரத்தத்தில் இருக்கும் நல்ல சர்க்கரைக்கு இன்சுலின் சுரக்கிறது கெட்ட சர்க்கரைக்கு இன்சுலின் சுரப்பதில்லை.

எது நல்லது, எது கெட்டது. முன்னால் பார்த்தோம் அல்லவா. செரிமானம் சரியாக இருந்தால் இரத்தத்தில் கலக்கும் சத்துப்பொருள் தரமானதாக இருக்கும் எனவும். செரிமானம் சரி இல்லை என்றால் தரமற்றவையாக இருக்கும்.

தரமான சர்க்கரையை, நல்ல சர்க்கரை என்றும். தரம் குறைந்த சர்க்கரை கெட்ட சர்க்கரை, என்றும் வைத்துக்கொள்வோம்.

நமது உடல் என்ன செய்யும் என்று செயல் விளக்கத்தோடு பார்தோம் ? நல்லதை ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளும், கெட்டதை வெளியேற்றும்.

அதேப்போல் தான் நல்ல சர்க்கரை ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளப்படுகிறது. கெட்ட சர்க்கரை சிறுநீரகம் மூலம் வெளியேற்றப்படுகிறது.

சரி. நாம் இப்பொழுது உண்கிறோம். என்ன நடக்கிறதென்று பார்ப்போம்.

உணவு வாயில் போட்டவுடன் உமிழ் நீர் கலந்து செரிமானம் வேலை ஆரம்பமாகிறது. பின் உணவு வயிற்றுக்கு செல்கிறது இங்கு அமிலம் மற்றும் பல செரிமான நீர்களுடன் கலந்து செரிமானம் ஆகிறது. பின் சிறுகுடலுக்கு சென்று பித்த நீர் கலந்து செரிமானம் ஆகிறது. சிறுகுடல் இறுதியில் சத்துப்பொருட்கள் இரத்தத்தில் கலக்கிறது.

நீங்கள் உண்ட உணவு அறைகுறையாக செரிமானம் ஆகி உள்ளது என்று வைத்துக்கொள்வோம். எனவே பாதி தரமான சத்துப்பொருளும், பாதி தரம் குறைந்த சத்துப் பொருளும் கிடைக்கிறது. இவை அனைத்தும் இரத்தத்தில் கலந்தாச்சு.

உதாரணத்திற்கு 100 சர்க்கரை கிடைத்துள்ளது என்று வைத்துக்கொள்வோம். இதில் 50 நல்ல சர்க்கரை, 50 கெட்ட சர்க்கரை. இது அனைத்தும் இரத்தில் ஒடிக்கொண்டிருக்கிறது. கணையம் அருகே வரும் போது. கணையம் ஒவ்வொறு சர்க்கரையாக பரிசோதனை செய்து பார்க்கும். இவை தரமானதா, தரமற்றதா. உடலுக்கு நன்மை செய்யக்கூடியதா, தீமை செய்யக்கூடியதா என்று பரிசோதித்து, நல்ல சர்க்கரைக்கு மட்டும் இன்சுலின் வழங்கும், ஒரு கெட்ட சர்க்கரைக்கும் கூட இன்சுலின்  வழங்காது.

நாம் முன்னே செயல் விளக்கத்தோடு பார்த்தோம் அல்லவா. உடல் நல்ல உணவிற்கு உழிழ் நீர் சுரந்தது, கெட்ட உணவிற்கு சுரக்கவில்லை. இதேதான் இங்கேயும் நடக்கிறது.

தற்போது இன்சுலினுடன் 50 சர்க்கரையும், இன்சுலின் இல்லாமல் 50 சர்க்கரையும் இரத்தத்தில் ஒடிக்கொண்டிருக்கிறது. செல்கள் இன்சுலின் உள்ள சர்க்கரைக்கு மட்டுமே கதவை திறக்கும். இந்த 50 நல்ல சர்க்கரையும் செல்களுக்குள்ளே போய்விடும். பின் இது எரிக்கப்பட்டு வெப்ப சத்தி நமக்கு கிடைக்கிறது. இந்த சத்தி மூலமே நாம் இயங்குகிறோம்.  இன்சுலின் இல்லாத சர்க்கரையை சிறுநீரகம் கண்டறிந்து சிறுநீர் மூலமாக வெளியேற்றிவிடுகிறது. உடலே நல்லதை, கெட்டதை கண்டறிந்து என்ன செய்ய வேண்டுமோ அதை செய்துவிட்டது. நாம் இப்பொழுது ஆரோக்கியமாக இருப்போம்.

நீங்கள் செய்யும் வேலைக்கு 30 சர்க்கரை போதும் என்று வைத்துக்கொள்வோம். மீதம் உள்ள 20 நல்ல சர்க்கரையை உடல் என்ன செய்யும் ?... உதாரணத்திற்கு நமக்கு தேவையைவிட பணம் அதிகம் இருந்தால் என்ன செய்வோம், சேமித்து வைப்போம் அல்லவா. அது போல் தான் உடல் தேவைக்கு அதிகமாக இருக்கும் சர்க்கரையை கூட்டு சர்க்கரையாக (Glycogen) செரிவூட்டி கல்லீரல், தசைநார்களில் சேமித்துவைத்துக்கொள்கிறது.

இந்த சேமிக்கப்பட்ட சர்க்கரை எப்போது எதற்கு பயன்படுகிறது, நாம் செய்யும் வேலைக்கு நல்ல சர்க்கரை போதவில்லை என்றால் லேசாக கிறுகிறுப்பு ஏற்பட்டு கண்கள் இருட்டடையும் போது இந்த சேமிக்கப்பட்ட சர்க்கரை இரத்தத்தில் கொட்டப்படுகிறது. நமக்கு ஏதாவது காயம் எற்பட்டால், அந்த காயத்திற்கு அருகில் இருக்கும் தசைநார்களில் சேமிக்கப்பட்ட சர்க்கரை அங்கு இருக்கும் செல்களை புதுப்பித்து காயத்தை ஆற்ற பயன்படுத்தபடுகிறது. நமக்கு எங்காவது விபத்து ஏற்பட்டு ரோட்டில் கிடந்தால், உறுப்புகள் சீராக இயங்குவதற்காக சேமிக்கப்பட்ட சர்க்கரை இரத்தத்தில் கொட்டப்பட்டு நமது உயிரை காக்க பயன்படுகிறது.

நாம் எப்படி நமக்கு பணம் இல்லாத போது சேமித்த பணத்தை பயன்படுத்துகிறோமோ. அது போல் நமது உடல் ஆபத்து காலங்களில் சேமிக்கப்பட்ட சர்க்கரையை பயன்படுத்துகிறது.

இப்ப சொல்லுங்க மனிதனுக்கு எது உண்மையான சொத்து ?... பணம் காசு வீடு, வாகனமா ? நிச்சயம் கிடையாது. நாம் சேமித்த சர்க்கரையே நமக்கு உண்மையான சொத்து.

எவர் வந்தாலும் வராவிட்டாலும். எது இருந்தாலும் இல்லாவிட்டாலும். இறுதியில், இந்த சர்க்கரையே உங்கள் கூட இருந்து உயிரை காக்கும். நாம் எதற்கு அதிக முக்கியத்துவம் தர வேண்டும் என்று நீங்களே முடிவு செய்து கொள்ளுங்கள்.

இப்பொழுது நமது உடல், நல்ல சர்க்கரை, கெட்ட சர்க்கரை, அதிகப்படியான நல்ல சர்க்கரைகளை எப்படி கையாள்கிறது என்று பார்தோம். இது மனிதன் தோன்றிய காலம் முதல் நடந்து வரும் இயற்கை நிகழ்வு.

இந்த மாவுச்சத்து பொருளுக்கு எவன் சர்க்கரை என்று பெயர் வைத்தான் என்று தெரியவில்லை. இது நம்மை குழப்புவதற்காக சூழ்ச்சி செய்து வைக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. செரிமான கோளாறால் ஏற்படும் அதிக நீரிழிவு பிரச்சனைக்கு எவன் சர்க்கரை நோய் என்று பெயர் வைத்தான் என்று தெரியவில்லை.

நாம் உண்ணும் சர்க்கரைக்கும் (இனிப்பு) இந்த சர்க்கரை நோய் என்று சொல்லப்படும் நீரிழிவு பிரச்சனைக்கும் துளி கூட சம்மந்தம் கிடையாது.

சர்க்கரை என்பது ஒரு சுவை. அவர்கள் கூறும் சர்க்கரை (மாவுச்சத்து) என்பது ஒரு சத்து பொருள்.

மனிதனுக்கு செரிமானம் நன்றாக இருக்க வேண்டும் என்றால் இனிப்பு சுவை மிக மிக அவசியமானது. இனிப்பு சுவையால் மட்டுமே உங்கள் வயிற்றிற்கும், மண்ணீரலுக்கும் சக்தி வழங்க முடியும்.

இலை போட்டு முதலில் இனிப்பு வைத்தவன் எல்லாம் முட்டாள்

வீட்டு தின்னையில் வழிப்போக்கர்களுக்கு ஒரு மூடி தேங்காயும் ஒரு உருண்டை கருப்பட்டி வைத்தவன் எல்லாம் முட்டாள்.

விழா காலங்களில் இனிப்பு பண்டம் செய்து உண்டவன் எல்லாம் முட்டாள்.

இனிப்பை சாப்பிடக்கூடாது என்று சொல்லும் ஆங்கில மருத்துவர்கள் அறிவாளிகள்.

எதற்கு இலையில் முதலில் இனிப்பை வைத்தார்கள் ? அனைத்து உணவையும் சாப்பிட்டுவிட்டு இறுதியில் இனிப்பை வீட்டிற்கு மூட்டைகட்டி செல்லவா !,  இனிப்பை முதலில் உண்ண வேண்டும். இனிப்பு சுவை நாக்கில் பட்டவுடன் மின்காந்த அலையாக மாறி நேரடியாக வயிற்றிற்கும், மண்ணீரலுக்கும் சக்தியை வழங்குகிறது. பின் நாம் என்ன சாப்பிட்டாலும் அது நன்கு செரிமானம் ஆகி நல்ல சத்துக்களாக இரத்தத்தில் கலக்கிறது.

உங்கள் மருத்துவர் என்ன சொல்லுவார் இனிப்பு சாப்பிடக்கூடாது. இனிப்பு சாப்பிடாவிட்டால் வயிறு, இதற்கு சக்தி வழங்கும் மண்ணீரலுக்கு சத்தி கிடைக்காது. இப்பொழுது உணவு உண்டால் செரிமானம் எப்படி இருக்கும் ? அறைகுறையாக. கிடைக்கும் சத்துப்பொருட்கள் பெரும்பாலும் கெட்ட சத்துப்பொருளாகவே இருக்கும். இவைகளை உடல் என்ன செய்யும் சிறுநீர் மூலம் வெளியேற்றிவிடும். நாம் எப்படி இருப்போம் சோர்வுடன் நோயாளியாகவே இருப்போம்.

நம்மை நோயாளியாக்கி சாகடிப்பதற்காக இவர்கள் செய்த முதல் தந்திரம். மாவுச்சத்திற்கு சர்க்கரை என்று பெயர் வைத்தது, இனிப்பு சாப்பிடக்கூடாது என்று சொன்னது.

இனிப்பை சாப்பிடக்கூடாது என்று செரிமானத்தை கெடுத்ததோட விட்டார்களா ! இல்லை.

இவர்களின் அடுத்த கட்ட கொலைகார செயல்களை பார்போம்.

இப்பொழுது உங்களுக்கு அதிக நீரிழவு, தாகம், சோர்வு, அதிக பசி. ஏற்படுகிறது இவை அனைத்திற்கும் என்ன காரணம்? அரைகுறை செரிமானத்தால் இரத்தத்தில் கலந்த கெட்ட சத்துப்பொருட்கள் வெளியேறுவதே காரணம். நீங்கள் என்ன செய்ய வேண்டும் ? செரிமானம் சரியாக என்ன வழிவகையோ அதை செய்ய வேண்டும். செரிமானத்தை சரி செய்தால் மேலே குறிப்பிட்ட அனைத்து பிரச்சனைகளும் சரியாகும்.

ஆனால் நீங்கள் என்ன செய்வீர்கள்,  உங்கள் அருகில் உள்ள மேதாவி உனக்கு சர்க்கரை நோய் இருக்கக்கூடும் போய் பரிசோதித்துக்கொள் என்பார். நீங்களும் பரிசேதனை செய்து பார்க்க போவீர்கள். அங்கு எவன் எப்பொழுது மாட்டுவன் எப்படியெல்லாம் அவன் தலையில் மிளகாய் அரைக்கலாம் என்று 5 வருடம் படித்துவிட்டு வெள்ளை கோர்ட்டு போட்டு கழுத்தில் பாசக்கயிறை மாட்டிக்கொண்டு ஒரு பூதம் உட்காந்திருக்கும். உங்கள் இரத்தத்தை பரிசோதனை செய்து பார்த்து, உங்களுக்கு சர்க்கரை அதிகம் உள்ளது. நீங்கள் சர்க்கரை நோயின் ஆரம்பகட்டத்தில் உள்ளீர்கள் என்பார்கள். இதில் என்ன பரிதாபமான விடையம் என்றால். நல்ல மற்றும் கெட்ட சர்க்கரை இரண்டிற்கும் இவர்களுக்கு வித்தியாசம் தெரியாது, இரண்டுமே சேர்த்துதான் இவர்களால் சொல்ல முடியும்.

அந்த சர்க்கரை நல்ல சர்க்கரையா, கெட்ட சர்க்கரையா ? கணையம் பரிசோதித்து இன்சுலின் வழங்கப்பட்டுவிட்டதா இல்லையா ? சர்க்கரை செல்களுக்குள் சென்று எரிக்கப்பட்டுவிட்டதா ? சிறுநீரகத்தால் கெட்ட சர்க்கரை கண்டரிந்து வெளியேற்றப்பட்டுவிட்டதா அல்லது வேலை நடந்து கொண்டிருக்கிறதா ? அதிக நல்ல சர்க்கரை தசைநார்களில் சேமிக்கப்பட்டுவிட்டதா, இல்லை சேமிப்பு வேலை நடந்து வருகிறதா ? நீங்கள் செய்யும் வேலைக்கு சர்க்கரை போதுமானதா இல்லையா என்று எதுவும் அந்த அப்பாவி Robotic மருத்துவர்களுக்கு தெரியாது. இவர்களுக்கு தெரிந்ததெல்லாம் அளவுகளை பார்த்து மாத்திரை கொடுப்பது மட்டுமே.

நல்ல சர்க்கரைக்கும், கெட்ட சர்க்கரைக்கும் இயந்திரங்களுக்கு வித்தியாசம் தெரியாது. இரண்டிற்கும் ஒரே Chemical formula வைத்தான் காட்டும், Glucose - C6H12O6. இதோ உதாரணம் அடிக்கரும்பு எப்படி இருக்கும் ?... நன்கு இனிப்பு சுவை உடையதாக இருக்கும் ங்க. சரி நுனிக் கரும்பு எப்படி இருக்கும் ?...
இனிப்பு குறைவாக சல்லென்று இருக்கும். இந்து அடிக்கரும்பையும், நுனிக்கரும்பையும் ஒரு Lab ல் கொடுத்து பரிசோதனை செய்யது பாருங்கள் Sucrose - C12H22O11 என்று ஒரே Chemical formula வைதான் காட்டும். எப்படி நமக்கு சுவையில் வித்தியாசம் தெரிந்து இயந்திரத்திற்கு தெரியவில்லையோ, அதேப்போல்தான் தரமான சர்க்கரைக்கும்( நல்ல )மற்றும் தரமற்ற சர்க்கரைக்கும் (கெட்ட) உடலுக்கு வித்தியாசம் தொரியும், இயந்திரங்களுக்கு தெரியாது.

இப்பொழுது புரிகிறதா ஏன் ஆங்கில மருத்துவத்திற்கு நல்ல மற்றும் கெட்ட சர்க்கரைக்கு வித்தியாசம் தெரியவில்லை என்று. இவர்கள் தன் சொந்த மூலையை விட மனிதன் உருவாக்கிய இயந்திரத்தை மட்டுமே நம்புவார்கள்.

சரி, இப்பொழுது நீங்கள் சர்க்கரை நோயாளி என்று முத்திரை குத்தப்பட்டுவிட்டார்கள். மாத்திரை எழுதி கொடுத்துவிட்டார்கள்.

இவர் எந்த அளவை வைத்து உங்களை சர்க்கரை நோயாளி என்று முடிவு செய்தார் ? யார் அளவை நிர்ணயம் செய்தது ? இந்த சர்க்கரை மாத்திரை எதற்கு கண்டுபிடிக்கப்பட்து ? உண்மையில் ஆரோக்கியத்திற்கு அளவு ஏதும் உண்டா ? என்று பார்ப்போம்.

ஆங்கில மருத்துவம் அறுவைசிகிச்சை செய்யத்துவங்கும் காலகட்டத்தில், இரத்த போக்கு அதிகம் ஏற்பட்டு உயிரிழப்பு அதிகம் ஏற்பட்டது. அறுவை சிகிச்சையின் போது ஒரு மாத்திரை கொடுக்கப்பட்டு அறுவைசிகிச்சை செய்துபார்த்தார்கள். இது அவர்களுக்கு வெற்றியாக அமைந்து. அறுவை சிகிச்சையின் போது மட்டுமே கொடுக்கப்பட்டு வந்த இந்த மாத்திரையை எப்படி உலகம் முழுவதும் வியாபாரம் செய்து கோடிகோடியாய் பணம் சம்பாதிப்பது என்று இரவு பகலாக ஆங்கில மருத்துவ உலகம், மருந்து மாத்திரை பெருநிறுவனங்கள் இணைந்து ஆலோசனை செய்து ஒரு முடிவிற்கு வந்தார்கள். அந்த முடிவு என்ன ?

சர்க்கரைக்கு அவர்களே ஒரு அளவை நிர்ணயித்து, இதற்கு மேல் சென்றாலும் நோய், கீழ் சென்றாலும் நோய் என்று பொய் பிரச்சாரம் செய்வதென முடிவெடுத்தார்கள்.

இதன் படி உலகம் முழுவதும் பெரும்பாலான மக்கள் மாட்டுவர்கள். இவர்களிடம் மாத்திரை விற்பனை செய்து கோடி கோடியாய் சம்பாதிக்கலாம் என்பதே இவர்களின் இலக்கு.

இந்த வியாபாரிகள் விரித்த வலையில் தான் நீங்கள் இப்போது சிக்கி உள்ளீர்கள்.

உண்மை என்னவென்றால் சர்க்கரை இவ்வளவுதான் இருக்க வேண்டும் என்ற எந்த அவசியமும் இல்லை. சர்க்கரையை பரிசோதித்து பார்பதே மிகப்பெரிய முட்டாள்தனம்.

ஒரு மனிதன், அவர் வாழும் பகுதி, அவர்கள் பண்பாடு, கலாச்சாரம், அவர் செய்யும் வேலை ( உடல் உழைப்பு), மன நிலை, உணவு, சுற்றுச்சூழல், நீர், செரிமாண மண்டலத்தின் சக்தி, பிராண சக்தி இவைகளை பொருத்து சர்க்கரையின் அளவு ஒவ்வொருவருக்கும் மாறிக்கொண்டே இருப்பது தான் இயற்கை.

உண்மை இப்படி இருக்கும் போது, எதன் அடிப்படையில் உலகம் முழுவதும் அனைத்து மனிதர்களுக்கும், இவர்களால் ஒரே அளவை நிர்ணயம் செய்ய முடிகிறது. இதை வைத்தே தெரியவில்லையா ?.... இவர்களின் நோக்கம் உலக மக்களை நோயாளிகளாக்கி,  அவர்களின் செவ்வம் மற்றும் ஆரோக்கியத்தை சுரண்டும் கொடூர பாவச்செயல்களை செய்கிறார்கள் என்று.

நீங்கள் என்ன செய்தீர்கள், மாத்திரை டப்பாவை வாங்கி வீட்டிற்கு வந்துவிட்டீர்கள். இப்பொழுது உணவெடுக்கிறீர்கள். செரிமானம் அறைகுரையாக இருக்கிறது. இதனால் 70 கெட்ட சர்க்கரையும், 30 நல்ல சர்க்கரையும் இரத்தத்தில் கலக்கிறது என்ற வைத்துக்கொள்வோம். உடல் என்ன செய்யும் 70 கெட்ட சர்க்கரையை கண்டரிந்து சிறுநீர் மூலமாக வெளியேற்றிவிடும். 30 நல்ல சர்க்கரை செல்களுக்குள் சென்றுவிடும்.

இப்பொழுது மாத்திரை சாப்பிடுகிறீர்கள். இது என்ன செய்யும் நேரடியாக கணையத்திடம் சண்டையிட்டு 70 கெட்ட சர்க்கரைக்கும் இன்சுலின் வாங்கி கொடுக்கும் கொடூர செயலை செய்யும், இந்த 70 கெட்ட சர்க்கரையும் இன்சுலினுடன் இரத்தத்தில் சுற்றிக்கொண்டிருக்கும். செல்கள் இன்சுலின் இருப்பதால் கதவை திறந்து ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளும். இந்த கெட்ட சர்க்கரையை செல்களால் சரியாக எரிக்கப்பட்டு வெப்ப சக்தியாக மாற்ற முடியாது. எனவே முதல் முதலில் உங்கள் செல்களில் கழிவு தங்குகிறது.

உதாரணத்திற்கு நல்ல சர்க்கரையை வெயிலில் நன்கு காய்ந்த விறகாக கற்பனை செய்துகொள்ளுங்கள். கெட்ட சர்க்கரையை காயாத ஈர விறகாக கற்பனை செய்துகொள்ளுங்கள். செல்களை அடுப்புகளாக கற்பனை செய்துகொள்ளுங்கள்.

அடுப்பின் வேலை என்ன?.. விறகை எரித்து வெப்ப சக்தி வழங்குவது. செல்களின் முக்கிய வேலை என்ன?.. சர்க்கரையை எரித்து வெப்ப சக்தி வழங்குவது. நன்கு காய்ந்த விறகை அடுப்பில் எரித்தால் அங்கு என்ன மிச்சம் இருக்கும் ?... சிறிது சாம்பல் மட்டுமே. வெப்ப சக்தியும் முழுமையாக கிடைத்துவிடும். ஈர விறகை எரித்தால் என்ன நடக்கும் ?... சரியாக எரியாமல் புகைந்து புகைந்து விறகு அடுப்பில் தங்கிவிடும். சரியாக வெப்ப சக்தியும் கிடைக்காது. இது போல் தான் நம் செல்களும் கெட்ட சர்க்கரையை முழுமையாக எரிக்க முடியாமல் கழிவு செல்களில் தங்கிவிடுகிறது.

உலகத்தில் உள்ள அனைத்து நோய்களுக்கும் ஒரே காரணம்தான். அது என்ன ? இயற்கை விதிமீறல் செயல்களால் கழிவுகள் நமக்குள் தங்குவதே காரணம். கழிவு தேக்கம் நோய். கழிவு நீக்கம் குணம்.

உடல் சரியாக கெட்ட சர்க்கரையை கண்டரிந்து சிறுநீர் மூலம் வெளியேற்றிய தரமற்ற சர்க்கரையை நாம் சொந்த செலவில் மாத்திரை வாங்கி சாப்பிட்டு செல்களுக்குள்ளையே செலுத்துவதுதான் உங்கள் அறிவியலின் உச்சகட்ட அற்புத செயல்.

சாக்கடைக்கு செல்ல வேண்டிய ஒரு தேவையற்ற பொருளை, நாம் செல்களுக்குளே செலுத்துவதால் கழிவுகள் செல்களில் தங்கி அந்த செல் பாதிக்கிறது. இத தொடர்ந்து நடக்கும் போது. அந்து உறுப்பு பாதிக்கிப்படுகிறது. உறுப்புகள் பாதிக்கப்பட்டால் அதன் வேலையை சரியாக செய்ய முடியாது. இதனால் மேலும் கழிவுகள் உள்ளேயே தங்க, சொல்லிலடங்கா துயரங்களுக்கு ஆளாகுகிறோம்.

இப்பொழுது தெரிகிறதா சர்க்கரை நோய் வந்தால் ஏன் எல்லா நோய்களும் வருகிறதென்று. சர்க்கரை நோய் என்னும் நீரிழிவு பிரச்சனை வந்தால் எந்த நோயும் வராது. இதற்கு மாத்திரை அல்லது இன்சுலின் ஊசி போடுவதின் மூலமே அனைத்து நோய்களும் வருகிறது.

சாதாரணமாக உள்ள செரிமானப்பிரச்சனையை சரி செய்திருந்தால் உங்கள் அனைத்து பிரச்சனையும் சரியாகியிருக்கும் அதைவிட்டுவிட்டு, பன்னாட்டு வியாபாரிகளின் கொடிய விசப் பொருட்களை துளி கூட சிந்திக்காமல், அப்படியே நாம் ஏற்றுக்கொண்டதால் உணர்ச்சியற்ற நோய் பிண்டங்களாக காட்சியளிக்கிறோம்.

நீரிழிவு காரணங்கள் !

சர்க்கரை நோய் என்னும் நீரிழிவு பிரச்சனைக்கு மூன்றே காரணம்தான். அனைத்து நீரிழிவு நோயாளிகளும் இதில் அடங்குவார்கள்.

1 - அதிக கவலை
2 - அவசரமாக சாப்பிடுவது
3 - அதிக உடல் வெப்பம்

சர்க்கரை நோயாளி என்னு சொல்லப்படும் செரிமானக் கோளாறு உள்ளவர்கள் அனைவருக்கும் இதில் ஒரு காரணமாவது நிச்சயம் பொருந்தும். பரிசோதித்து பாருங்கள். என்னங்க நான் சொன்னது சரியா... !

*எப்படி குணப்படுத்துவது  ?*

1 : கவலை - சாப்பிடும் பொழுது கவலை எல்லாம் மறந்து உணவின் மேல் முழுகவனமும் செலுத்தி சாப்பிட வேண்டும். கவலைக்கு உண்டான காரணங்களை சரி செய்ய முயற்சிக்க வேண்டும்.

2 : அவசரமாக சாப்பிடுவது - அவசரமாக டிக்கட் எடுக்க விரும்புபவர்கள் தாராளமாக அவசரமாக சாப்பிடலாம். "நொறுங்கத்தின்றால் நூறு ஆயுசு", பசி எடுத்தால் மட்டுமே உணவெடுக்க வேண்டும்.
ஒரு முறை நன்கு சிந்தித்து பாருங்கள் நாம் எதற்காக இவ்வளவு பாடுபடுகிறோம் என்று, இறுதியில் சாப்பிடுவதற்காகவே என்று உணர்வீர்கள். அதை இப்பவே உணர்ந்து பொறுமையாக சாப்பிடலாமே. நம் நலனுக்காக நம் உடலை இவ்வளவு பாடுபடுத்துகிறோம், ஏன் உடல் நலனுக்காக நாம் 1/2 மணி நேரம் ஒதுக்கி பொறுமையாக சாப்பிடக்கூடாது.

சாப்பிடும் பொழுது உலகத்தையே மறந்துவிட வேண்டும். உணவிற்கு முன் இனிப்பான பழங்களை சாப்பிட வேண்டும். சாப்பிடும் போது உணவை பார்த்து நமது முழு கவனமும் உணவின் மேல் செலுத்தி மென்று ரசித்து ருசித்து சாப்பிட வேண்டும்.

கோதுமையை முற்றிலும் தவிர்க்க வேண்டும்.

3 : அதிக உடல் வெப்பம் - பச்சை தண்ணீரில் குளிப்பது. வாரம் இரண்டு நாள் எண்ணெய் குளியல். நீர்காய்கனிகளை அதிகம் சாப்பிட வேண்டும்.

இனி இந்த செரிமானப்பிரச்சனையை யாரும் நோய் என்று சொல் வேண்டாம். நீரிழிவு என்பதே பொருந்தும். தேவையில்லாத, கெட்ட சத்து பொருட்கள் அனைத்தும் சிறுநீர் முலமே வெளியேறும், சர்க்கரை மட்டும் அல்ல. நீரிழிவை சரி செய்ய மேலே குறிப்பிட்ட மூன்று காரணத்தையும் சரி செய்தால் குணம் பெற்றுவிடுவீரகள்.

சர்க்கரை நோய் - செரிமானக்கோளாறால் ஏற்படும் நீரிழிவு பிரச்சனை.

தீர்வு - இனிப்பான பழங்களை சாப்பிடுவது. உணவை பசிக்கும் போது மென்று ரசித்து ருசித்து சாப்பிடுவது.

இனி நாம் யாரும் பன்னாட்டு வியாபாரிகளின், உயிரை குடிக்கும் இரசாயண மாத்திரைகளையும் இன்சுலின்களையும் எடுக்க மாட்டோம் என்று உறுதி எடுப்போம். மூளையில், மழுங்கி கிடக்கும் நமது முளையை சற்று பயன்படுத்தி சிந்திக்க துவங்குவோம்.

பன்னாட்டு கொலைகார வியாபாரிகளின், கொடூர வச தன்மை உள்ள பொருட்களை விற்கும் சந்தையாக உங்கள் உடலை மாற்றிவிடாதீர்கள்.

"உள்ளமே பெருங்கோவில்
ஊநுடலே ஆலையமாம்"
ஆலயத்தை ஆரோக்கியமாக வைத்துக்கொள்வீர்கள் என்று நம்புகிறேன்.

உண்மையில் சர்க்கரை நோய் என்று ஒரு நோய் உலகில் இல்லை

இது முழுக்க முழுக்க மருந்து மாத்திரை கம்பனிக்காரர்களின் வியாபார தந்திரம்.

இனிப்பிற்கும், சர்க்கரை நோய்கும் 0.1% கூட சம்பந்தம் கிடையாது. 

இதற்கு சர்க்கரை நோய் என்று பெயர் வைத்ததிலேயே மிகப்பெரிய தந்திரம் இருக்கிறது. 

லேசாக தலை சுற்றலே, சோர்வே, மயக்கமே வந்து விட கூடாது. உடனே 
நீங்கள் பயந்து போய், பரிசோதனை செய்து பார்ப்பீர்கள், அளவு அவர்கள் நிர்ணயித்ததை விட குறைவாகவே, அதிகமாகவோ இருக்கக்கூடும், உடனே உனக்கு சர்க்கரை நோய் உள்ளது, இந்தா இந்த மாத்திரையை போடுனு எழுதி கொடுத்துவிடுவார். 

இதோட நிறுத்தினால் பரவாயில்லை, மாத்திரை போடலைனா அது வந்துரும், இது வந்துரும் னு பயப்படுத்தி, ஒரு பெரிய பட்டியலை காட்டி இதோ பாருங்க சர்க்கரை நோய் வந்தா இந்த எல்லா நோய்களும் வந்துவிடும்னு சொல்வார். 

ஆனால், உண்மை என்ன தெரியுமா, சர்க்கரை நோய் வந்தால் எல்லா நோயும் வராது. சர்க்கரைக்கு அவர்கள் கொடுக்கும் மாத்திரை சாப்பிடுவதால் மட்டுமே எல்லா நோயும் வருகிறது. அந்த மாத்திரை பெட்டியிலேயே இதை சாப்பிட்டால் சிறுநீரக கேன்சர் வரும் என்று எழுதியிருப்பது யாருக்காவது தெரியுமா !

ஆங்கில மருத்துவம் நிர்ணயிக்கும் அளவுகள் எல்லாம் நம் ஆரோக்கியத்தை மையப்படுத்தி நிர்னையிக்கும் அளவுகள் அல்ல. 

அளவுகள் நிர்ணயிப்பது யார் தெரியுமா ? மருந்து மாத்திரை கம்பனிக்காரர்களே ! வியப்பாய் உள்ளதா, இது தான் உண்மை.

உலகில் உள்ள ஒவ்வொரு மனிதனுக்கும், அவரவர் வாழும் பகுதி, செய்யும் வேலை, உணவு, மனம், சுற்றுச்சூழல் இதை பொருத்து சர்க்கரை அளவு
மாறிக்கொண்டே இப்பது தான் இயற்கை. 

இப்படி இருக்கும் போது, எதன் அடிப்படையில், உலகில் உள்ள அனைத்து மனிதர்களுக்கும் பொதுவான அளவை நிர்ணயம் செய்ய முடிகிறது. 

சர்க்கரை நோய் என்று சொல்லப்படும் சிறிய பிரச்சனைப்பற்றி மக்களுக்கு முழு விழிப்புணர்வு ஏற்படுத்துவதற்காக 
படித்தவுடன் உங்களின் நண்பர்களுக்கு, அனைவரும் விழிப்புணர்வு ஏற்படுத்துமாறு கண்டிப்பாக பகிருங்கள். விழிப்புணர்வுடன் பகிர்ந்தால் குறைந்தபட்சம் ஒரு குடும்பத்தையாவது நிம்மதியுடன் வாழ வைக்க முடியும்.
17/10/16, 5:11 PM - natarajan ramu: என் அன்பு சகோதர, சகோதரிகளே,😀😀😀
                 😀😀நரேந்திர மோடி யை 21ஆம் ஆண்டு சாணக்கியன் என்று சொல்கிறார்களே ஏன்?
இந்த குறுஞ்செய்தியையை படிக்கும் போது ஆசியா வரைபடத்தை யை கையில் வைத்து கொண்டு படிக்கவும்.
                  நமது பாரதத்தின் பரம்பரை எதிரிகள் பாகிஸ்தான் மற்றும் சைனா மற்றும் தற்போது நேபாளில் உள்ள Prachant  கம்யூனிஸ்ட் Government 
                   இதை தவிர இஸ்லாமிய நாடுகளில் தாமும் இஸ்லாமியன் என்று பாகிஸ்தான் கட்சி சேர்க்க பார்க்கிறது. இவைகள் அத்தனைகளிலிருந்தும் நம்மை   காப்பாற்றுவதற்கு திரு மோடி  என்ன செய்து இருக்கிறார்
                        சைனா நமது பாரதத்தை நான்கு பக்கமும் சூழ்ந்து கொள்ள முயற்சி செய்து கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. அதே மாதிரி அதற்கு பதிலாக திரு மோடி முதலில் பூடான் நாட்டை தன் பக்கம் சேர்த்து கொண்டார். பிறகு சைனாவின் வடக்கே இருக்கும் மங்கோலியா என்ற ஏழை நாட்டுடன் நட்புறவு கொண்டார். மங்கோலியா நாடு சீனாவின் பயங்கர எதிரி. மங்கோலியா நாட்டிற்க்கு பல மறைமுகமான உதவிகளை செய்து இருக்கிறார். அதை தவிர பாரதத்தின் பரம் சூப்பர் கம்ப்யூட்டர் யை அன்பளிப்பாக கொடுத்திருக்கிறார். பிறகு பாரதத்தின்  line of control சர்ச்சை கூறியதாக உள்ளது. ஆதலால் திரு மோடி  சொல்கிறார் BSF (Boarder Security Fource) நமது படையினருக்கு சரியான பயிற்சி கிடைப்பது இல்லை.
                               அப்போது மங்கோலியாவின் பெருமளவு எல்லை சைனாவுடன் ஒட்டிக் கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. ஆதலால் திரு  மோடி  பத்தாயிரத்துக்கும் மேலே ஜவான்களை மங்கோலியாவிற்கு பயிற்சி பெறுவதற்க்காக அனுப்பி இருக்கிறார்.
            🍇🍇இந்த விஷயம் எத்தனை பேருக்கு தெரியும் ?
                   சைனாவின் கிழக்கே அவர்களுடைய பரம்பரை எதிரி ஜப்பான். அந்த ஜப்பானின் Prime Minister Shinjo Abe உடன் திரு மோடி  நட்புறவு கொண்டார். அவர்களிடம் இருந்து பல விதமான உதவிகளை பெற்று கொண்டு இருக்கிறோம் என்று எல்லோருக்கும் தெரிந்ததே.
                  🎉🎉சைனாவின் தெற்கே வியட்னாம் உள்ளது. வியட்னாமிற்கும் சைனாவிற்கும் ஆகாது.பரம்பரை எதிரிகள். திரு மோடி  வியட்னாமிற்கு சென்றார். வியட்னாமிற்கு திரு மோடி  உதவிகள் செய்து உள்ளார் எப்படி? அம்பானி குரூப் கம்பெனியையும் ESSAR குரூப் கம்பெனியையும் அங்கே எண்ணெய் பதார்த்தங்களை பூமியிலிருந்து எடுப்பதற்கு உதவி செய்ய அனுப்பி இருக்கிறார். அதை தவிர நமது ராணுவத்தை அங்கே இந்தியாவின் பிரம்மோஸ் மிசைல்களை அங்கே செட் செய்து இருக்கிறார்கள். 
                     💛💛பர்மாவிடம் இருந்து சைனா இந்தியன் பாரதிய  வங்க கடலில் உள்ள சில தீவுகளை மிரட்டி வாங்கிவிட்டது. அதை develop (வளர்ச்சி அடைய) பண்ணுகிறோம் என்று என்று கோக்கோ தீவு என்று பெயரை வைத்து இந்தியாவிக்கு அபாயகரமாக இருக்கும் வகையில் செய்துருக்கிறார்கள் .
                      💓💓அப்போது திரு மோடி  ஆசியா பசுபிக் நாட்டின்  மாநாட்டின் பொது திரு மோடி பர்மா சென்று இருந்தார். அவர் பர்மாவிடம் இருந்து நாங்களும் தீவுகளை develop (வளர்ச்சி அடைய ) பண்ணி கொடுக்கிறோம் என்று மூன்று தீவுகளை விலைக்கு வாங்கி விட்டார். இந்த மூன்று தீவுகளும் அந்த கோக்கோ வை சுற்றியுள்ளது.
          🏵🏵குறிப்பு:   திரு மோடி  அந்த மூன்று தீவுகளையும் பாரத நாட்டின் பெயரில் வாங்கி இருக்கிறார். தன் குடும்பத்தின் பெயரிலோ  அல்லது கட்சியின் பெயரிலோ வாங்கவில்லை🍇🍇🍇
                 சைனாவின் தெற்கே உள்ள நாடுகள் கஜகஸ்தான், உஸ்பெகிஸ்தான், தஜிகிஸ்தான் என்ற நாடுகளுக்கும் திரு மோடி சென்று வந்தார். அந்த மூன்று  நாடுகளும் முன் காலத்தில் ரஸ்யாவின் அங்கங்களாக இருந்தன. தற்பொழுது சுதந்திரமாக இருந்து கொண்டிருக்கின்றன. இவைகள் ஏழை நாடுகள் . அந்த மூன்று நாடுகளுடன் ஆப்கானிஸ்தானையும் சேர்த்து ஒரு எண்ணெய் கேஸ் பைப் லைன் கட்டி தருவதற்கு ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி விட்டார். இதனால் ஒரு தந்திரமான நட்புறவு  பண்ணி விட்டார்.
சைனா பாகிஸ்தானுடன் ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி கொண்டு விட்டது. பாரதத்தின் தெற்கு பக்கம் இந்தியன் கடல் வழியாக நுழைந்து வருவதற்கு வழி பண்ணி கொண்டிருக்கிறது. எப்படி?
பாகிஸ்தானின் தெற்க்கே உள்ள பகுதி பலூசிஸ்தான். அந்த பலூசிஸ்தானில் Gwadar என்ற துறைமுகத்திற்கு செல்ல ரோடு ஒன்றை கட்டி கொடுத்திருக்கிறார். Gwadar துறைமுகத்தை வளர்ச்சி அடைய செய்கிறோம் என்று சொல்லி விட்டு சீனா தன் கடற்படை (NAVY BASE) அங்கு அமர்த்தி விட்டது.
திரு மோடி  ஈரானுக்கு சென்று அங்குள்ள தலைவர்களை சந்தித்து ஒரு தந்திரமான வேலை செய்து இருக்கிறார். அது என்ன?
Gwadar துறைமுகத்திலிருந்து கடல் மார்கமாக 75 மைல் சென்றால் வடக்கே ஈரானின் துறைமுகம் CHABHAR உள்ளது. அங்கே அந்த துறைமுகத்தை வளர்ச்சி பண்ண ஒப்பந்தம் இந்தியா எடுத்து கொண்டது. அதனுடன் கூடவே ரஷ்யாவிலிருந்து  கிளம்பி கஜகஸ்தான், உஸ்பெகிஸ்தான்,  & ஆப்கானிஸ்தான் வழியாக  CHABHAR துறைமுகத்திற்கு செல்வதற்கு ஒரு  8 line Highway கட்டி தருவதாக ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி இருக்கிறார். அந்த 8 line Highway ஒப்பந்தம் இந்தியன் கம்பெனிக்கு வாங்கி கொடுத்திருக்கிறார்.
குறிப்பு: நெடுஞ்சாலையின் ஒப்பந்தங்கள் திரு மோடி யின் சொந்தக்காரர்களோ அல்லது நண்பர்களோ கிடையாது 
இப்படி ரஷ்யாவை இந்தியன் கடல்  வரையிலும் செல்வதற்கு வழி பண்ணி கொடுத்து விட்டார். CHABHAR துறைமுகத்தில் ர ஷ்யாவும் GWADAR துறைமுதத்தில் சைனாவையும் ஒருவருக்கொருவர் மோத விட்டார். அதே மாதிரி பாரதத்தின் ஏடன் கடலில் வலுவான வழியை ஏற்படுத்தி கொடுத்து விட்டார். அந்த வழியில் தான் swayze canal இருக்கிறது. அதன் வழியாக தான் ஐரோப்பிய நாடுகளுக்கு பாரதத்திலிருந்து போகும் பொருட்கள் அந்த வழியாக தான் செல்கின்றன.
இதை தவிர பலூசிஸ்தானில் பாக்கிஸ்தான் செய்யும் அட்டூழியங்களையும், ராட்சஸிய கொடுமைகளையும் உலகத்தின் உள்ள எல்லா நாடுகளின் முன்னே சமர்ப்பித்து விட்டார். ஆதலால் இப்பொழுது பாகிஸ்தான் மனசில் பலூசிஸ்தானும் நம்மளை விட்டு போய்விடும் என்ற பயத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி விட்டார். சைனா அந்த ஏரியாவில் பயங்கரமான செலவு செய்தது வீணாகி போய்விடும் என்ற பயத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி விட்டார். இப்பொழுது அதே விஷயத்தில் அந்த இரு நாடுகளும் வாயை பொத்தி விட்டு வீட்டில் உட்கார்ந்து விட்டனர்.
போன வருடம்  இலங்கையில் நமது RAW (INDIAN SECRET SERVICE) அங்கிருக்கும் தலைவரை விலைக்கு வாங்கி ஆளுங்கட்சியினரை தோல்வி அடைய செய்து திரு. மஹிந்த ராஜபக்ஷ வை வீட்டுக்கு அனுப்பி விட்டார்கள். செய்து திரு. மஹிந்த ராஜபக்ஷசை சைனாவுடன் ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி பாரதத்திற்கு விரோதமான பல செயல்களை செய்து கொண்டு இருந்தார். புது ஆட்சி வந்தவுடன் அந்த பாரதத்தின் எதிரே உள்ள நிர்ணயங்களை புது ஆட்சி அடித்து நொறுக்கி விட்டது. வெகு தூரம் உள்ள சைனாவால் ஒன்றும் செய்ய முடியவில்லை.
பக்கத்தில் இருக்கும் நாடுகள் நேபாள் பூடான், பர்மா, பங்களாதேஷ், இவர்கள் எல்லோருடனும் FREE TRADE ECONOMIC CORRIDOR என்ற வர்த்தகத்தை இலாபம் அடைய சூழ்நிலையை ஏற்படுத்தி விட்டார். எல்லா விதத்திலையும் இந்த நாடுகளை பாரதத்தின் நண்பர்களாக மாற்றி விட்டார். பங்களாதேஷனுடன் பல வருடங்களாக இருக்கும் எல்லை பிரச்னையை அடியோடு ஒழித்து விட்டார்.
ஆப்கானிஸ்தான் என்ற நாடு பல வருடங்களாக தாலிபான் என்ற இயக்கத்தினால் துன்பம் அடைந்து கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. அதே துன்பத்தை அவர்களுக்கு கொடுப்பதில் பாகிஸ்தானும் பெரும் பங்கு வகிக்கிறது. நமது பாரதம் பல விதத்தில் அவர்களுக்கு பண உதவியும், பொருள் உதவியும் செய்து கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. அதை தவிர ஆப்கானிஸ்தானிற்கு நமது பாரத படைகள் உதவிகள் செய்து கொண்டிருக்கின்றன. நீண்ட காலமாக ஆப்கானிஸ்தானும், பாரதமும் நட்புறவு வைத்து கொண்டிருக்கிறது. கடந்த சார்க் கமிட்டி நாடுகளின் கூட்டத்தில்   ஆப்கானிஸ்தான் பிரதம மந்திரி திரு மோடி உடன் வெகு நேரம் பேசிக் கொண்டிருந்தார்.
சைனா தன்னுடைய இலாபத்தை தான் பார்க்கும். சைனாவின் பல சரக்குகள் பாரதத்தில் பெரும் அளவில் விற்கப்படுகின்றன. பாரதமும் பாகிஸ்தானும் அவர்களுடைய அந்தரங்க சண்டையில் சைனா  தலையிடுவதற்கு இஷ்டம் இல்லை .
ஜம்முகாஷ்மீர், சிந்து நதி பிரச்சனை,  Terrarium, எல்லை பிரச்சனைகள் இந்த மாதிரி பலவித பிரச்சனைகளில் சைனா தலையிட தயாராக இல்லை . சைனா பாகிஸ்தானை போன்ற பிச்சைக்கார  நாடுகளை ஆதரவு செய்து தன்னுடைய பாரதத்தில் இருக்கும் வியாபாரத்தை விட தயாராக இல்லை
சவூதி அரேபியா நாட்டிற்கு எல்லா விதமான PUBLIC PROJECT களில் இந்திய தொழிலாளர்கள் பெருமளவில் இருக்கிறார்கள். செப்டம்பர்  9 2011-இல் சில அரபிக்  Terrorist  அமெரிக்காவில் பாம் வைத்த விஷயம் எல்லோருக்கும் தெரியும், அப்போதிலிருந்து அமெரிக்காவும் சவூதி அரேபியாவிற்கும் இடையே உள்ள Relationship கெட்டு விட்டது. ஆதலால் சவூதி அரேபியாவிற்கு வெள்ளைக்காரர்கள் வேலை செய்ய தயாராக இல்லை. சவூதி அரேபியாவிற்கு மூல ஆதாரமான பூமியிலிருந்து வரும் எண்ணையும் , அதற்க்கு உதவிகரமாக இருக்கின்ற இன்ஜினீயர்களும் தேவை. இதற்கு இந்தியர்கள் தானே குறைவான சம்பளத்திற்கு வேலை செய்கிறார்கள்.
திரு மோடி  சவூதி அரேபிய போய் இருந்த  பொழுது இந்த குறிப்பிகளை அவர்களின் ராஜாவிடம் சொல்லி பல சலுகைகளை வாங்கி கொடுத்திருக்கிறார்.  சவுதிஅரேபியா பாகிஸ்தானுக்கு SUPPORT பண்றதையே விட்டு விட்டார்கள்.
திரு மோடி  யும் அமெரிக்காவின் PRESIDENT ஒபாமா வும் நல்ல நட்புறவு கொண்டு இருக்கிறார்கள். ஆதலால் அமெரிக்கா நாடு பாரதத்திற்கு விரோதமான காரியங்களை செய்வதை கைவிட்டு விட்டது .அமெரிக்காவின் பெரிய  பெரிய கம்பெனிகளில் உயர் அதிகாரிகள் பலர் இந்தியர்களாக இருக்கின்றார்கள். பாரதத்தின் software export-  யும் பாரதத்தின் திடகாத்திரமான பொருளாதாரத்தையும் தற்பொழுது அமெரிக்காவில் நல்ல விதத்தில் எதிரொலிக்கிறது.


United national- லில் உயர்ந்த கமிட்டி அதன் பெயர்   (UN Security Council) அதில் ஐந்து நாடுகள்  உறுப்பினர்கள் அமெரிக்கா, பிரிட்டன், ஜப்பான், ஜெர்மனி, பிரான்ஸ், அதில் மேலும் ஒரு  நாடு சுழற்சி முறையில்  உறுப்பினர் ஆக்கப்படுவார்கள்.  அந்த Security  Council  லில் உறுப்பினர் ஆவதற்கு பாரதம் முயற்சி செய்து தோற்று விட்டது. ஏனென்றால் பிரான்ஸ் என்ற நாடு நாம் வருவதை தடுத்து கொண்டு இருந்தது. அந்த பிரான்சின் வாயை அடக்கி விட்டார். பாரதத்தின் பக்கம் அவர்களை திருப்பி விட்டார் எப்படி ? பிரான்ஸ் தயாரிக்கும் Rafael என்ற ஆயுத விமானத்தை பெருமளவில் வாங்கி பிரான்சின் வாயை அடைத்து விட்டார்.
குறிப்பு: Rafael விமானத்தை வாங்கியதில் திரு மோடி  தனக்கும் தன் உறவினர்களுக்கும் கமிஷன் பேசவில்லை
திரு மோடி   ஆப் பிரிக்க கண்டத்தில் உள்ள எல்லா நாடுகளையும் டெல்லிக்கு அழைத்தார். அவர்களுக்கு மாநாடு  வைத்து பாரதத்தின் உதவியும் வலிமையும் காண்பித்தார். எல்லா ஆப்ரிக்க நாடுகளுக்கும் அவரவர்களுடைய தேவைக்கு தகுந்தாற் போல் உதவி செய்ய ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி விட்டார் . ஆதலால் இப்பொழுது பாரதத்திற்கு அரபிக் கடலில் எந்த ஆப்ரிக்க நாடுகளும் தொந்தரவு பண்ணாது.
தற்பொழுது பாகிஸ்தானில் நடக்க போகும் மாநாட்டை திரு மோடி செய்த புது புது தோழர்கள் (பூடான், பங்களாதேஷ், ஆப்கானிஸ்தான்) அவர்களின் உதவியால் அந்த மாநாட்டை ஒன்றும் இல்லாமல் ஆக்கிவிட்டார்.
இவ்வளவு காரியங்களையும் இரண்டு வருட காலத்தில் செய்து விட்டார்
இப்பொழுது புரிகிறதா
பாகிஸ்தான் பாரதம் கா ஷ்மீரில் பாரத ராணுவம் தாக்கிய பொழுது பாகிஸ்தான் ஏன் எதிர்ப்பு செய்யவில்லை. ஆம் பாரதம் தாக்கி இருக்கிறது என்று சொன்னால் அவர்களிடத்தில் Terrorist இருக்கிறார்கள் என்று ஒத்துக் கொள்வதாய் ஆகிவிடும் இல்லை என்றால் பாகிஸ்தான் ராணுவத்தின் மனோதைரியம் உடைந்து விடும்.
இந்த மாதிரி காரியங்களை செய்வதற்கு அறிவு வேண்டும் , சக்தி வேண்டும் விடா முயற்சி  வேண்டும் , நாட்டு பற்று வேண்டும், கடினமான உழைப்பு வேண்டும் மனோதைரியம் வேண்டும் & character சுத்தமாக இருக்க வேண்டும். இந்த குணங்கள் வேறு எந்த தலைவர்களிடம் இருக்கிறது?


ஏ. சி ரூமில் படுத்து கொண்டு வெத்தலைப்பாக்கு தின்று கொண்டு பெரிய வயிற்றை தடவி கொண்டிருக்கும் வீரர்களுக்கு இவ்வளவு திறமை கிடையாது.
இந்த நாட்டை காப்பாற்றுவதற்கு ஒரு சாதாரண நல்ல தாயின் பிள்ளை திருமதி ஹீரா வின் பிள்ளை மாவீரன் திரு மோடி  அவர்களே போதும். இப்பேற்பட்ட பாரதத்தின் பிள்ளையை வணங்குங்கள் , 
இப்பேற்பட்ட உயர்ந்த மனிதனுக்கு கை கொடுங்கள். எதுவுமே முடியாவிட்டால் பரவாயில்லை அவரை மட்டும் கேவலப் படுத்தாதீர்கள்

சூரிய சக்தியை பயன்படுத்தினார்.
உடலின் இயற்கையான நோய் எதிர்ப்பு சக்தியை பயன்படுத்தி செய்யும் இயற்கை வழிச் சிகிச்சை முறையில் நம்பிக்கையுடையவர்.
அவரது கட்டுரையைக் கீழே பார்ப்போம்;

"புற்றுநோயைக் குணப்படுத்தும் உத்திகளில் இதுவும் ஒன்று!!
புற்றுநோயைக் குணப்படுத்தும் எனது சிகிச்சைமுறைகளில், சமீபகால வெற்றிவிகிதம் 80%.

புற்றுநோயாளிகள் மரணத்தைத் தழுவக்கூடாது.புற்றுநோயாளிக்கான சிகிச்சை ஏற்கனவே கண்டறியப்பட்டுள்ளது- அது நாம் பழங்கள் எடுத்துக் கொள்ளும் முறையில் உள்ளது.

நீங்கள் நம்புவீர்களோ இல்லியோ, இதுவரை வழக்கமான சிகிச்சை முறையில் இறந்த நூற்றுக்கும் அதிகமான புற்று நோயாளிகளுக்கான நான் வருத்தப்படுகிறேன்.

பழங்கள் சாப்பிடும் முறை;;

எல்லோரும் நினைப்பது பழங்கள் சாப்பிடுவது என்றால்,அவற்றை விலைக்கு வாங்கி, வெட்டி, வாயிலிட்டு சாப்பிடுதல் என்று.

நீங்கள் நினைப்பது போல் எளிதானதல்ல அது. பழங்களை 'எப்படி' அதுவும் '*எப்போது'* சாப்பிடவேண்டும் என்பது மிகவும் முக்கியம்.

பழங்களைச் சாப்பிடும் சரியான முறை என்ன?

பழங்களைச் சாப்பிடுவதென்றால், சாப்பிட்ட பிறகு பழங்களை எடுத்துக் கொள்வது அல்ல!!

பழங்களை வெறும் வயிற்றிலேயே சாப்பிட வேண்டும்!!

பழங்களை வெறும் வயிற்றில் எடுத்துக் கொண்டால், அது நம் உடலின் நச்சுக்களை வெளியேற்றுவதிலும், எடை குறைப்பு, மற்றும்
வாழ்வின் மற்ற செயல்களுக்குத் தேவையான அதிகப்படியான ஆற்றலைத் தருவதிலும் பெரும் பங்கு வகிக்கிறது!!

பழங்கள் ஒரு முக்கியமான உணவு;

சாதாரணமாக நீங்கள் இரண்டு துண்டுகள் பிரட், அதன்பின் ஒரு துண்டு பழம் என்று எடுத்துக் கொள்கிறீர்கள் எனக் கொள்வோம்.

பழத்துண்டு வயிற்றின் வழியே நேராகக் குடலுக்குள் செல்லத் தயாராக இருக்கிறது. ஆனால் பழத்திற்கு முன்னால் எடுத்துக்கொண்ட
'பிரட்' டினால் பழம் குடல் பகுதிக்குச் செல்வது தடுக்கப்படுகிறது.

இந்த சராசரி நேரத்தில் முழு உணவான பிரட் மற்றும் பழம் இரண்டும் அழுகி, புளித்து, அமிலமாக மாறுகிறது.

பழம் வயிற்றிலுள்ள உணவு மற்றும் செரிமானத்துக்கு உதவும் சாறுகளுடனும் சேரும் நிமிடத்தில், அந்த முழு நிறையான உணவு கெட்டுப் போக ஆரம்பிக்கிறது.

அதனால் தயவு செய்து பழங்களை *வெறும் வயிற்றில்* அல்லது #உணவுக்கு முன்# சாப்பிடுங்கள்.!!

பலர் புகார் கூறுவதைக் கேட்டிருப்பீர்கள்.

""ஒவ்வொரு முறை நான் தர்ப்பூசணி பழம்( Watermelon) எடுக்கும்போதெல்லாம் எனக்கு ஏப்பம் வருகிறது, எப்போது நான் துரியன் பழம் சாப்பிட்டாலும் வயிறு ஊதிக் கொள்கிறது, எப்போது நான் வாழைப்பழம் சாப்பிட்டாலும், அவசரமாக கழிவறைக்கு ஓட வேண்டியிருக்கிறது, இன்னும் பல .. . . .

உண்மையில் நீங்கள் வெறும் வயிற்றில் பழம் எடுத்துக் கொண்டால், இந்த மாதிரி நிலைமை தோன்றாது!

உணவுக்குப் பின் பழம் எடுக்கும் போது, பழமானது மற்ற உணவுடன் சேர்ந்து அழுகுவதால் , வாயு உற்பத்தியாகி வயிறு ஊதக் காரணமாகிறது!!

நரை முடி தோன்றுவது, தலையில் வழுக்கை விழுவது, நரம்புகளின் திடீர் எழுச்சி, கண்களின் கீழ் கருவளையம் தோன்றுவது இவை யெல்லாமே, வெறும் வயிற்றில் பழங்கள் எடுத்துக் கொண்டால்,
** நடக்காமல் தடுக்கப்படும்**

ஆரஞ்சு, எலுமிச்சை போன்ற பழங்களெல்லாம் அமிலத்தன்மையுடையவை என்பதெல்லாம் உண்மையில்லை! ஏனென்றால் Dr. Herbert Shelton என்பவர் இந்த. வகையில் ஆராய்ச்சிகள் செய்து. கூறியதன்படி,எல்லாப் பழங்களும், நமது உடலுக்குள் சென்றதும் காரத்தன்மையுடையவையாகின்றன.

சரியான முறையில் பழங்கள் சாப்பிடும் வகையை முழுவதுமாக அறிந்து கொண்டால், நமக்கு, அழகு,நீண்ட ஆயுள்,உடல் ஆரோக்கியம், உடலுக்குத் தேவையான சக்தி, மகிழ்ச்சி, மற்றும் சரியான எடை இவற்றைப் பெறும் **ரகசியம்** கிடைத்து விடும்.

3)நீங்கள் பழச்சாறு அருந்தும் தேவை ஏற்படும்போது, **புதிதான** பழச்சாறுகளையே அருந்துங்கள். டின், பாக்கட்,மற்றும் பாட்டில் இவற்றில் அடைக்கப்பட்ட ரெடிமேட் பழச்சாறுகள்**வேண்டாம்**.

சூடாக்கப்பட்ட பழச்சாறுகளையும் குடிக்க வேண்டாம்.

பதப்படுத்தப்பட்ட, சமைத்த பழங்களையும் உண்ணாதீர்கள்.ஏனெனில் அவற்றிலிருந்து உங்களுக்கு எந்த விதமான சத்துக்களும் கிடைக்காது.

சமைத்த பழங்களில் அதிலுள்ள விட்டமின்கள் அனைத்தும் அழிக்கப் படுகின்றன.உங்களுக்கு அதன் சுவை மட்டுமே கிடைக்கிறது.

ஆனால் பழச்சாறு சாறு அருந்துவதை விட , பழங்களை முழுதாகச் சாப்பிடுவது மிகவும் சிறந்தது.

நீங்கள் பழச்சாறு குடிப்பதாயிருந்தால், மடமடவென்று குடிக்காமல்,மெதுவாக ஒவ்வொரு வாயாக அருந்தவும்.ஏனென்றால், நீங்கள் பழச்சாறு விழுங்குவதற்கு முன், அதனை வாயிலுள்ள உமிழ்நீரோடு நன்கு கலக்கச் செய்து பின் உள்ளே அனுப்பவும்.

உங்கள் உடல் உறுப்பக்களைச் சுத்தம் செய்யவும், உடலிலிருந்து நச்சுக்களை வெளியேற்றவும். ஒரு 3- நாட்கள் பழங்கள் மட்டுமே எடுத்துக் கொண்டு விரதம் இருக்கலாம்.

அந்த 3 நாட்களும், பழங்களை மட்டும் சாப்பிட்டு, மற்றும் புதிதாய் எடுக்கப்பட்ட பழச்சாறுகளையும் மட்டுமே நாள் முழுவதும் எடுத்துக் கொள்ளுங்கள்.

இந்த டயட்டின் முடிவு நீங்களே ஆச்சரியப் படும்படி, நீங்கள் மிகவும் அழகாய், வனப்புடன் தோற்றமளிப்பதாய் உங்கள் ஃபிரண்ட்ஸ் கூறும்போது உணர்வீர்கள்.

கிவி பழம்;

இது ஒரு சிறிய ஆனால் வலிமை மிகுந்த பழம்.
இப்பழம் பொட்டாசியம், மக்னீஷியம், விட்டமின்- ஈ. மற்றும் நார்ச்சத்துக்கள் நிறைந்த ஓர் நல்ல பழம்.
ஆரஞ்சுப் பழத்தை விட விட்டமின்-சி சத்து கிவி பழத்தில் இரண்டு மடங்கு அதிகம் உள்ளது.

ஆப்பிள்;
ஒரு நாளைக்கு ஒரு ஆப்பிள் என எடுத்துக் கொண்டால். நோயின்றி வாழலாம் என்று சொல்வது உண்மையே!

ஆப்பிளில் விட்டமின்-சி சத்து குறைவாக இருப்பினும்,அதில் உள்ள antioxidants ,flavonoids போன்றவை இந்த விட்டமின் - சி சத்துக்களை மேம்படுத்துவதால், பெருங்குடல் புற்று நோய்,மாரடைப்பு, பக்கவாதம் போன்ற ஆபத்துக்களைக் குறைக்கிறது!

ஸ்ட்ராபெர்ரி ;
பாதுகாப்பு தரும் பழம்.
இந்தப் பழத்தில் மற்ற எல்லாப் பழங்களையும் விட. மொத்த Antioxidant சக்தி இருப்பதால்,இது நம் உடலில் சுதந்திரமாய் கட்டுப்பாடற்று பல்கிப் பெருகும் அடிப்படைக் கூறுகளால் ( free radicals) இரத்த நாளங்களில் அடைப்பு, புற்று நோய்க் காரணிகள் பெருகுதல் முதலியவை ஏற்படாமல் நம்மைப் பாதுகாக்கிறது.

ஆரஞ்சு;
இனிப்பான மருந்து.

ஒரு நாளைக்கு 2-4 ஆரஞ்சு எடுப்பது ஜலதோஷத்தை விலக்கும்.கொழுப்பைக் குறைக்க உதவும்.மேலும் சிறுநீரகக் கற்களைக் கரைப்பதோடு, கற்கள் வராமலும் தடுக்கும்.
அதனுடன் பெருங்குடல் புற்றுநோயின் ஆபத்தினைக் குறைக்கிறது.

தர்பூசணி;

மிகவும் குளிர்ச்சியான ஒரு தாகம் தீர்ப்பான்.
92% தண்ணீர்ச் சத்துக்களையுடையது.
மேலும் இந்தப் பழத்தில் மாபெரும் அளவில் Glutathione இருப்பதால்,அது நம் உடம்பின் நோய் எதிர்ப்பு சக்தியை அதிகரிக்க உதவுகிறது.
மேலும் இது lycopene. என்னும் புற்று நோயை எதிர்த்துப் போராடும் ஒரு oxidant இன் முக்கிய ஆதாரமாகவும் உள்ளது.
தர்ப்பூசணியில் உள்ள மற்ற சத்துக்கள் விட்டமின் -சி , பொட்டாசியம் ஆகியவை.

கொய்யா& பப்பாளி

இவை இரண்டுமே விட்டமின் - சி நிறைந்தது.உயர் விட்டமின்-சி கொண்ட பழங்களைத் தேர்வு செய்தால் சந்தேகத்துக்கிடமின்றி வெற்றி பெறும் தகுதியுடையவை.
கொய்யாப்பழம் நார்ச்சத்து அபரிமிதமாக உள்ளதால், மலச்சிக்கலைத் தடுக்க உதவுகிறது.

பப்பாளிப்பழம் Carotene சத்துக்கள் நிறைந்தது எனவே கண்களுக்கு மிகவும் நல்லது.
##################
உணவிற்குப் பிறகு குளிர்ந்த தண்ணீர் அல்லது பானங்கள் குடிப்பது = புற்று நோய்.

இந்த தகவலைப் பெறும் ஒவ்வொரு நபரும், 10 நபர்களுக்காவது இத்தகவலை அனுப்பினால்,நிச்சயமாய் ஒரு உயிரையாவது காப்பாற்றலாம் செய்வீர்களா?

20/10/16, 7:14 PM - Vidya Perima: If u lose your mobile in India, you can get it back.

Got an interesting fact to share.. 

Nowadays each one of us 
carries very costly or latest 
mobile devices which always 
creates fear in mind  that it may be stolen.

Each mobile carries a unique 
IMEI no. i.e. International Mobile Equipment Identity No which 
can be used to track your 
mobile anywhere in the world.

This is how it works!!

1. Dial *#06# from your mobile.

2. Your mobile shows a unique 
    15 digit.

3. Note down this number anywhere 
     but not in your mobile as 
     this is the number which will 
     help trace your mobile in 
     case of its theft.

4. Once stolen you just have to 
     E-mail this 15 digit IMEI No. 
     to cop@vsnl.net with detail 
     Mentioned below.
   
Your name:____________________
Address:______________________
Phone model:_________________
Make:_________________________
Last used No.:_________________
E-mail for communication:_____
Missed date:___________________
IMEI No :_______________________

      5. No need to go to the 
          police.

      6. Your Mobile will be traced 
           within next 24 hrs via a 
           complex system of GPRS 
          and internet, You will find 
          where your hand set is 
          being operated even in 
          case your No. is 
          changed 

PASS ON THIS 
IMPORTANT 
MESSAGE TO ALL YOUR 
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.

24/10/16, 11:49 AM - natarajan ramu: What  is the difference between http and https ?
Time to know this with 32 lakh debit cards compromised in India.

 Many of you may be aware of this difference, but  it is 
 worth sharing for any that are not.....

 The  main difference between http:// and https:// is  all 
 about keeping you secure 

HTTP stands  for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol  
The  S (big  surprise)  stands for "Secure"..  If you visit a 
 Website or web page, and look at the address in the web    browser, it is likely begin with the following: http:///. 

This  means that the website is talking to your  browser using 
the regular unsecured language.  In other words, it is possible for someone to  "eavesdrop" on your computer's conversation with  the Website. If you fill out a form on the  website, someone might see the information you send to that site. 
      
    This  is why you never ever enter your credit card  number in an 
    Http website! But if the web address begins with https://, that 
    means your computer is talking to the website in  a 
    Secure code that no one can eavesdrop on.  
    You understand why this is so important, right?  
      
    If  a website ever asks you to enter your Credit/Debit card 
    Information, you should automatically look to see if the web 
    address begins with https://. 
      
    If  it doesn't,  You should NEVER enter sensitive 
    Information....such as a credit/debit card  number. 
      
     PASS  IT ON (You may save someone a lot of grief).
24/10/16, 4:02 PM - natarajan ramu: #கிராமத்து_பாட்டியும்_சம்பா_சாகுபடியும்

ஒரு கிராமத்துல ஒரு பாட்டி தன் பேரனோடு வசித்து வந்தார்.
ஒரு நாள் அந்த பாட்டி காலில் புண் ஏற்பட்டுவிட்டது.

நீண்ட நாள்களாகியும் காலில் இருந்த புண் ஆறவில்லை.
இதனால் பாட்டியுன் பேரன் மிகவும் வருத்தமடைந்தான்.

பேரனின் நண்பன் ஒருவன்.. பாட்டியின் காலில் ஏற்பட்டிருக்கும் புண் குணமடைய தினமும் கடல்நீரை எடுத்துவந்து காலில் ஊற்றினால் போதும் என்றான்.

அதை கேட்ட பேரனுக்கு மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சி.
வீட்டிற்கு வந்தவனுக்கு திடிரென்று ஒரு சந்தேகம் உண்டாகியது.

கடல்நீரோ பொதுச்சொத்து. தனிமனிதன் சுயநலத்திற்காக பொதுச்சொத்தான கடல்நீரை பயன்படுத்தலாமா..? 
என்ற குழப்பம் உண்டாகியது..

எதற்கும் விஏஓ விடம் அனுமதி பெற்றுவிடலாம் என்று..
விஏஓவிற்கு ஒரு  கடிதம் எழுதினான்.

மதிப்பிற்குரிய விஏஓ அவர்களே.. இதுமாதிரி  என் பாட்டிக்கு உடம்பு சரியில்ல.. கடல்தண்ணீர எடுத்து பயன்படுத்த உங்கள் அனுமதி வேண்டும்னு கேட்டு எழுதினான்.

கடிதத்தை படித்த விஏஓ அதிர்ச்சி அடைந்தார். இது எவன் செஞ்ச கூத்துனு தெரியலயே.. இதுவரைக்கும் எவனும் இது மாதிரி ஒரு அனுமதி கேட்டதில்லையே.. இப்படி ஒருத்நன் கேட்குறான்னாலே ஏதோ வில்லங்கம் இருக்குனு அர்த்தம்..

நமக்கெதுக்கு வம்பு பேசாம தாசில்தார்க்கு அனுப்பிடுவோம்னு.. 
பேரன் எழுதுன கடிதத்ததையும் சேர்த்து 
அனுப்பினார்.

தாசில்தாசிரிடம் அந்த கடிதம் சென்றது.
தாசில்தார் பார்த்தார். அந்த விஏஓவுக்கும் நமக்கும் ரொம்ப நாளா வாய்க்கா தகராறு.. எப்படி நம்மள பழிவாங்கலாம்னு பார்த்துட்டு இருந்தான்.. அவன்தான் ஏதோ சூழ்ச்சி பண்றான்.. பேசாம இதை கலெக்டருக்கு அனுப்பிடுவோம்னு.. 
மாவட்ட ஆட்சியர் அவர்களே.. எங்க பகுதி  கிராமத்து பாட்டி காலுல புண்ணு.. அதற்கு கடல் தண்ணிய பயன்படுத்திக்க அனுமதிக்கிறிங்களானு..? கேட்டு அவர் ஒரு கடிதம் எழுதினார்.

கடிதம் கலெக்டர் கைக்கு கிடைத்தது.
கலெக்டர் யோசித்தார். அனுமதி கேட்டவன் ஆளுங்கட்சிகாரனா எதிர்க்கட்சி காரனானு தெரியலயே..

கேட்டவன் ஆளுங்கட்சிகாரனா இருந்து அனுமதி கொடுத்துட்டா எதிர்க்கட்சிக்காரன் போராட்டம் நடத்துவான்.

கேட்டவன் எதிர்க்கட்சிக்காரனா  இருந்து அனுமதி கொடுத்துட்டா ஆளுங்கட்சிகாரன் கோபத்துக்கு ஆளாகனும்..
நமக்கு எதுக்கு வம்புனு.. கலெக்டர் சம்பந்தப்பட்ட துறைக்கு அனுப்பி வைத்தார்.

 அனுமதி கடிதம் அமைச்சர் கையில் கிடைத்தது. எந்த கிறுக்கன் இப்படி ஒரு பிரச்சினைய கெளப்புனதுனு தெரியலயே.. தெரியாத்தனமா அனுமதி கொடுத்துட்டு நாளைக்கு திரும்பி வந்தாங்கனா நம்ப அமைச்சர் பதவியே காலியாகிடுமேனு..

ஆத்து  தண்ணி, குளத்து தண்ணி , கிணத்து தண்ணிதான் மாநில அரசுகளின் கட்டுப்பாட்டில் வரும்.. நீங்கள் கேட்பதோ கடல் தண்ணி.. கடலோர பாதுகாப்பு மத்திய அரசு கட்டுப்பாட்டுல வரும்..
அதனால உங்கள் அனுமதி கடித்தத்தை நான் மத்திய அரசுக்கு அனுப்புறன்னு கலெக்டருக்கு அமைச்சர் பதில் எழுதினார்.

கடிதம் மத்திய நீர்வளத்துறையின் கையில் கிடைத்தது. அமைச்சர் பிரதமரிடம் பேசினார்.
அவரோ தான் பல வெளிநாடுகளுக்கும் பயணம் செய்திருப்பதாகவும்.. அந்த அனுபவத்தின் படி பார்த்தால்..
என்னதான் கடலின் ஒரு கரை நம்ம நாட்டில் இருந்தாலும் அடுத்தகரை அடுத்த நாட்டில் உள்ளது. எனவே கடல் தண்ணியை எடுத்து பயன்படுத்துவது என்பது சர்வதேசப்பிரச்சினை..
ஆகவே அதுகுறித்து ஐநாசபையில் பேசி அனுமதி வாங்கும் வரை கடல்தண்ணியை எடுத்து பாட்டி காலை கழுவுவதற்கு தடை விதிக்கப்படுகிறது என்று.. 
மத்திய அரசின் உத்தரவு மாநில அமைச்சருக்கு வந்து..
மாநில அமைச்சரிடம் இருந்து
மாவட்ட கலெக்டருக்கு வந்து..
மாவட்ட கலெக்டரிடமிருந்து
தாசில்தாருக்கு வந்து அவரிடமிருந்து
விஏஓக்கு வந்து..
விஏஒ விடமிருந்து பாட்டியோட பேரன் கைக்கு  கிடைத்த போது பாட்டி செத்து நாற்பது நாளாகி இருந்தது.

(இந்த கதை சிரிக்க மட்டுமல்ல.... :( 🙁 )
24/10/16, 5:26 PM - Pornima Akka: பாரீஸ் நகரில்...ரயில் நிலையம் அருகில்
ஒருமுறை ஒரு பயங்கர வெடிகுண்டு
சம்பவம் நடந்த்து.....

தாக்குதல் நடத்திய குற்றவாளிகள்
அனைவரும் தப்பித்தனர்....
ஆனால் அவர்களுடன்....இந்த செயலுக்கு  மிகவும் உறுதுணையாக இருந்த ஒரு பயிற்சி...நாய் மட்டும் போலீசார் வசம் சிக்கி கொண்டது...

ஆனால் அந்த நாயை வைத்துக்கொண்டு போலீசாரால் துப்புத்துலக்க முடியவில்லை....

காரணம் அது எந்த முறையில்....எந்த மொழியில் பயிற்சி கொடுக்கப்பட்டது என்ற விபரம் அங்கிருந்த யாருக்கும் தெரியவில்லை.....!

(உதாரணத்திற்க்கு..... யானைக்கு ..சமஸ்க்கிருத மொழி விளங்கும்  என்று பலரும் சொல்ல கேட்டதுன்டு அதைப்போல....

ஒரு ஹிந்திகாரன் வீட்டில் வளரும் நாய்
பைட்டோ பைட்டோ என்றால் உட்கார்ந்து கொள்ளுமாம்....இதைப்போல...)

எப்படியாவது இந்த நாயை வைத்தே குற்றவாளிகளின் இருப்பிடத்தை கண்டறிந்து...அவர்களை கைது செய்ய
முடிவெடுத்தனர்
எல்லாரும் முயற்சி செய்து ஒரு வழியாக...ஒரு பன்மொழி கலைஞரை அழைத்தனர்.....அவருக்கு...60 மொழிகள் வரை அத்துப்படி...... அவர் ஒரு புரஃபெஸரும் கூட....

அவரும் வந்து.... வித விதமான மொழிகளை பேசி முயற்சி செய்தும் பயன் இல்லை...அந்த நாயிக்கும் ஒன்றும் புரியவே இல்லை....

கடைசியில்.... பழம்பெரும் மொழிகளில் ஒன்றான ஹிப்ரு என்ற மொழியில்...அவர் பயிற்சியை துவக்கியதும் ...நாய்க்கு புரிய ஆரம்பித்தது.....உடன் அதை வைத்து குற்றவாளிகளின் இருப்பிடம் கண்டு....உடன் கைது செய்தது பாரீஸ் போலீஸ்......

அந்த புரஃபெஸருக்கு பாராட்டுக்கள் குவிந்தது.....

அவருக்கு பாரீஸ் அரசாங்கம் ஏகப்பட்ட விருதுகளை அள்ளித்தர முடிவு செய்தது... பெரிய விருந்து ஒன்றையும்
ஏற்பாடு செய்தது

விருந்தில் அவரிடம் கேட்க்கப்பட்டது

உங்களால் பாரீஸ் பெருமை அடைந்தது... ...

உங்களுக்கு என்ன வேண்டும்
 கேளுங்கள் வழங்கபடும் என்றனர்....

பணம் வேண்டுமா.....?

விலை கூடிய கார்கள் வேண்டுமா..?
 மாளிகை வேண்டுமா....?
அரசாங்க பணிகள் வேண்டுமா...?
என்று... 

அவர் மறுத்துவிட்டார்...

எனக்கு உதவியாக இருந்த அந்த...நாயை மட்டும் தயவு செய்து எனக்கு வழங்கிவிடுங்கள்...என்றார்...

அதை கேட்டு அங்கிருந்த
 அனைவருக்கும் ஆச்சர்யம்....
சிலர் இவருக்கு பைத்தியம் என்றனர்....

ஒரு அதிகாரி கேட்டார்..... ஏன் அந்த நாயை வைத்து நீங்கள் என்ன செய்ய முடியும்..... என்று ஆச்சரியத்துடன் கேட்டார்....

அதற்க்கு அவர்...சொன்னார்....

இந்த நாயை என் வீட்டிற்க்கு கொண்டு போய்....என் மனைவி முன் நிறுத்தவேண்டும்..... ஏன் என்றால்  நான் கஷ்டப்பட்டு இந்த பல மொழிகள் படிக்க முயலும்போதெல்லாம்....

அவள் சொல்வாள்....

"எந்த நாய் கேட்க்க போகுதுன்னு...
இதையெல்லாம் படிக்கிறீங்கன்னு.."...

அதுக்காக தான் இதை கொண்டுபோகணும்னு சொன்னவுடன்

அரங்கம் சிரிப்பொலியில் நிறைந்தது..

ஹாஹாஹாஹா......

Letter from a man in Birmingham to his friend in London: 
I was fed up with being burgled and robbed every other day in my neighbourhood. The alarm system was no use so I tore it out and deregistered from our ineffective local Neighbourhood Watch.

Instead, I've planted a Pakistani flag in each corner of my front garden...
Now, the city police, the National Security Bureau, Scotland Yard, MI-5, MI-6, the CIA and every other intelligence service in Europe are all keeping watch on my house 24x7x365... 
I'm followed to and from work every day and my wife too when she goes out shopping. So no one bothers us at all... I've never felt so safer... 
All thanks to 
"Pakistan."

The Church Prayed Daily against the bar business.

Days later the bar was struck by lightning & caught fire which destroyed it.

Bar Owner Sued the Church Authorities for the cause of its destruction, as it was an action because of their Prayer.

The Church Denied all Responsibility!!!

So, the judge commented,

"It's Difficult to Decide the Case because here we have a Bar Owner Who Believes in the Power of Prayer & an Entire Church that Doesn't Believe in it"

01/11/16, 8:44 PM - natarajan ramu: என் அன்பு சகோதர, சகோதரிகளே,😀😀😀
                 😀😀நரேந்திர மோடி யை 21ஆம் ஆண்டு சாணக்கியன் என்று சொல்கிறார்களே ஏன்?
இந்த குறுஞ்செய்தியையை படிக்கும் போது ஆசியா வரைபடத்தை யை கையில் வைத்து கொண்டு படிக்கவும்.
                  நமது பாரதத்தின் பரம்பரை எதிரிகள் பாகிஸ்தான் மற்றும் சைனா மற்றும் தற்போது நேபாளில் உள்ள Prachant  கம்யூனிஸ்ட் Government 
                   இதை தவிர இஸ்லாமிய நாடுகளில் தாமும் இஸ்லாமியன் என்று பாகிஸ்தான் கட்சி சேர்க்க பார்க்கிறது. இவைகள் அத்தனைகளிலிருந்தும் நம்மை   காப்பாற்றுவதற்கு திரு மோடி  என்ன செய்து இருக்கிறார்
                        சைனா நமது பாரதத்தை நான்கு பக்கமும் சூழ்ந்து கொள்ள முயற்சி செய்து கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. அதே மாதிரி அதற்கு பதிலாக திரு மோடி முதலில் பூடான் நாட்டை தன் பக்கம் சேர்த்து கொண்டார். பிறகு சைனாவின் வடக்கே இருக்கும் மங்கோலியா என்ற ஏழை நாட்டுடன் நட்புறவு கொண்டார். மங்கோலியா நாடு சீனாவின் பயங்கர எதிரி. மங்கோலியா நாட்டிற்க்கு பல மறைமுகமான உதவிகளை செய்து இருக்கிறார். அதை தவிர பாரதத்தின் பரம் சூப்பர் கம்ப்யூட்டர் யை அன்பளிப்பாக கொடுத்திருக்கிறார். பிறகு பாரதத்தின்  line of control சர்ச்சை கூறியதாக உள்ளது. ஆதலால் திரு மோடி  சொல்கிறார் BSF (Boarder Security Fource) நமது படையினருக்கு சரியான பயிற்சி கிடைப்பது இல்லை.
                               அப்போது மங்கோலியாவின் பெருமளவு எல்லை சைனாவுடன் ஒட்டிக் கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. ஆதலால் திரு  மோடி  பத்தாயிரத்துக்கும் மேலே ஜவான்களை மங்கோலியாவிற்கு பயிற்சி பெறுவதற்க்காக அனுப்பி இருக்கிறார்.
            🍇🍇இந்த விஷயம் எத்தனை பேருக்கு தெரியும் ?
                   சைனாவின் கிழக்கே அவர்களுடைய பரம்பரை எதிரி ஜப்பான். அந்த ஜப்பானின் Prime Minister Shinjo Abe உடன் திரு மோடி  நட்புறவு கொண்டார். அவர்களிடம் இருந்து பல விதமான உதவிகளை பெற்று கொண்டு இருக்கிறோம் என்று எல்லோருக்கும் தெரிந்ததே.
                  🎉🎉சைனாவின் தெற்கே வியட்னாம் உள்ளது. வியட்னாமிற்கும் சைனாவிற்கும் ஆகாது.பரம்பரை எதிரிகள். திரு மோடி  வியட்னாமிற்கு சென்றார். வியட்னாமிற்கு திரு மோடி  உதவிகள் செய்து உள்ளார் எப்படி? அம்பானி குரூப் கம்பெனியையும் ESSAR குரூப் கம்பெனியையும் அங்கே எண்ணெய் பதார்த்தங்களை பூமியிலிருந்து எடுப்பதற்கு உதவி செய்ய அனுப்பி இருக்கிறார். அதை தவிர நமது ராணுவத்தை அங்கே இந்தியாவின் பிரம்மோஸ் மிசைல்களை அங்கே செட் செய்து இருக்கிறார்கள். 
                     💛💛பர்மாவிடம் இருந்து சைனா இந்தியன் பாரதிய  வங்க கடலில் உள்ள சில தீவுகளை மிரட்டி வாங்கிவிட்டது. அதை develop (வளர்ச்சி அடைய) பண்ணுகிறோம் என்று என்று கோக்கோ தீவு என்று பெயரை வைத்து இந்தியாவிக்கு அபாயகரமாக இருக்கும் வகையில் செய்துருக்கிறார்கள் .
                      💓💓அப்போது திரு மோடி  ஆசியா பசுபிக் நாட்டின்  மாநாட்டின் பொது திரு மோடி பர்மா சென்று இருந்தார். அவர் பர்மாவிடம் இருந்து நாங்களும் தீவுகளை develop (வளர்ச்சி அடைய ) பண்ணி கொடுக்கிறோம் என்று மூன்று தீவுகளை விலைக்கு வாங்கி விட்டார். இந்த மூன்று தீவுகளும் அந்த கோக்கோ வை சுற்றியுள்ளது.
          🏵🏵குறிப்பு:   திரு மோடி  அந்த மூன்று தீவுகளையும் பாரத நாட்டின் பெயரில் வாங்கி இருக்கிறார். தன் குடும்பத்தின் பெயரிலோ  அல்லது கட்சியின் பெயரிலோ வாங்கவில்லை🍇🍇🍇
                 சைனாவின் தெற்கே உள்ள நாடுகள் கஜகஸ்தான், உஸ்பெகிஸ்தான், தஜிகிஸ்தான் என்ற நாடுகளுக்கும் திரு மோடி சென்று வந்தார். அந்த மூன்று  நாடுகளும் முன் காலத்தில் ரஸ்யாவின் அங்கங்களாக இருந்தன. தற்பொழுது சுதந்திரமாக இருந்து கொண்டிருக்கின்றன. இவைகள் ஏழை நாடுகள் . அந்த மூன்று நாடுகளுடன் ஆப்கானிஸ்தானையும் சேர்த்து ஒரு எண்ணெய் கேஸ் பைப் லைன் கட்டி தருவதற்கு ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி விட்டார். இதனால் ஒரு தந்திரமான நட்புறவு  பண்ணி விட்டார்.
சைனா பாகிஸ்தானுடன் ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி கொண்டு விட்டது. பாரதத்தின் தெற்கு பக்கம் இந்தியன் கடல் வழியாக நுழைந்து வருவதற்கு வழி பண்ணி கொண்டிருக்கிறது. எப்படி?
பாகிஸ்தானின் தெற்க்கே உள்ள பகுதி பலூசிஸ்தான். அந்த பலூசிஸ்தானில் Gwadar என்ற துறைமுகத்திற்கு செல்ல ரோடு ஒன்றை கட்டி கொடுத்திருக்கிறார். Gwadar துறைமுகத்தை வளர்ச்சி அடைய செய்கிறோம் என்று சொல்லி விட்டு சீனா தன் கடற்படை (NAVY BASE) அங்கு அமர்த்தி விட்டது.
திரு மோடி  ஈரானுக்கு சென்று அங்குள்ள தலைவர்களை சந்தித்து ஒரு தந்திரமான வேலை செய்து இருக்கிறார். அது என்ன?
Gwadar துறைமுகத்திலிருந்து கடல் மார்கமாக 75 மைல் சென்றால் வடக்கே ஈரானின் துறைமுகம் CHABHAR உள்ளது. அங்கே அந்த துறைமுகத்தை வளர்ச்சி பண்ண ஒப்பந்தம் இந்தியா எடுத்து கொண்டது. அதனுடன் கூடவே ரஷ்யாவிலிருந்து  கிளம்பி கஜகஸ்தான், உஸ்பெகிஸ்தான்,  & ஆப்கானிஸ்தான் வழியாக  CHABHAR துறைமுகத்திற்கு செல்வதற்கு ஒரு  8 line Highway கட்டி தருவதாக ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி இருக்கிறார். அந்த 8 line Highway ஒப்பந்தம் இந்தியன் கம்பெனிக்கு வாங்கி கொடுத்திருக்கிறார்.
குறிப்பு: நெடுஞ்சாலையின் ஒப்பந்தங்கள் திரு மோடி யின் சொந்தக்காரர்களோ அல்லது நண்பர்களோ கிடையாது 
இப்படி ரஷ்யாவை இந்தியன் கடல்  வரையிலும் செல்வதற்கு வழி பண்ணி கொடுத்து விட்டார். CHABHAR துறைமுகத்தில் ர ஷ்யாவும் GWADAR துறைமுதத்தில் சைனாவையும் ஒருவருக்கொருவர் மோத விட்டார். அதே மாதிரி பாரதத்தின் ஏடன் கடலில் வலுவான வழியை ஏற்படுத்தி கொடுத்து விட்டார். அந்த வழியில் தான் swayze canal இருக்கிறது. அதன் வழியாக தான் ஐரோப்பிய நாடுகளுக்கு பாரதத்திலிருந்து போகும் பொருட்கள் அந்த வழியாக தான் செல்கின்றன.
இதை தவிர பலூசிஸ்தானில் பாக்கிஸ்தான் செய்யும் அட்டூழியங்களையும், ராட்சஸிய கொடுமைகளையும் உலகத்தின் உள்ள எல்லா நாடுகளின் முன்னே சமர்ப்பித்து விட்டார். ஆதலால் இப்பொழுது பாகிஸ்தான் மனசில் பலூசிஸ்தானும் நம்மளை விட்டு போய்விடும் என்ற பயத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி விட்டார். சைனா அந்த ஏரியாவில் பயங்கரமான செலவு செய்தது வீணாகி போய்விடும் என்ற பயத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி விட்டார். இப்பொழுது அதே விஷயத்தில் அந்த இரு நாடுகளும் வாயை பொத்தி விட்டு வீட்டில் உட்கார்ந்து விட்டனர்.
போன வருடம்  இலங்கையில் நமது RAW (INDIAN SECRET SERVICE) அங்கிருக்கும் தலைவரை விலைக்கு வாங்கி ஆளுங்கட்சியினரை தோல்வி அடைய செய்து திரு. மஹிந்த ராஜபக்ஷ வை வீட்டுக்கு அனுப்பி விட்டார்கள். செய்து திரு. மஹிந்த ராஜபக்ஷசை சைனாவுடன் ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி பாரதத்திற்கு விரோதமான பல செயல்களை செய்து கொண்டு இருந்தார். புது ஆட்சி வந்தவுடன் அந்த பாரதத்தின் எதிரே உள்ள நிர்ணயங்களை புது ஆட்சி அடித்து நொறுக்கி விட்டது. வெகு தூரம் உள்ள சைனாவால் ஒன்றும் செய்ய முடியவில்லை.
பக்கத்தில் இருக்கும் நாடுகள் நேபாள் பூடான், பர்மா, பங்களாதேஷ், இவர்கள் எல்லோருடனும் FREE TRADE ECONOMIC CORRIDOR என்ற வர்த்தகத்தை இலாபம் அடைய சூழ்நிலையை ஏற்படுத்தி விட்டார். எல்லா விதத்திலையும் இந்த நாடுகளை பாரதத்தின் நண்பர்களாக மாற்றி விட்டார். பங்களாதேஷனுடன் பல வருடங்களாக இருக்கும் எல்லை பிரச்னையை அடியோடு ஒழித்து விட்டார்.
ஆப்கானிஸ்தான் என்ற நாடு பல வருடங்களாக தாலிபான் என்ற இயக்கத்தினால் துன்பம் அடைந்து கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. அதே துன்பத்தை அவர்களுக்கு கொடுப்பதில் பாகிஸ்தானும் பெரும் பங்கு வகிக்கிறது. நமது பாரதம் பல விதத்தில் அவர்களுக்கு பண உதவியும், பொருள் உதவியும் செய்து கொண்டு இருக்கிறது. அதை தவிர ஆப்கானிஸ்தானிற்கு நமது பாரத படைகள் உதவிகள் செய்து கொண்டிருக்கின்றன. நீண்ட காலமாக ஆப்கானிஸ்தானும், பாரதமும் நட்புறவு வைத்து கொண்டிருக்கிறது. கடந்த சார்க் கமிட்டி நாடுகளின் கூட்டத்தில்   ஆப்கானிஸ்தான் பிரதம மந்திரி திரு மோடி உடன் வெகு நேரம் பேசிக் கொண்டிருந்தார்.
சைனா தன்னுடைய இலாபத்தை தான் பார்க்கும். சைனாவின் பல சரக்குகள் பாரதத்தில் பெரும் அளவில் விற்கப்படுகின்றன. பாரதமும் பாகிஸ்தானும் அவர்களுடைய அந்தரங்க சண்டையில் சைனா  தலையிடுவதற்கு இஷ்டம் இல்லை .
ஜம்முகாஷ்மீர், சிந்து நதி பிரச்சனை,  Terrarium, எல்லை பிரச்சனைகள் இந்த மாதிரி பலவித பிரச்சனைகளில் சைனா தலையிட தயாராக இல்லை . சைனா பாகிஸ்தானை போன்ற பிச்சைக்கார  நாடுகளை ஆதரவு செய்து தன்னுடைய பாரதத்தில் இருக்கும் வியாபாரத்தை விட தயாராக இல்லை
சவூதி அரேபியா நாட்டிற்கு எல்லா விதமான PUBLIC PROJECT களில் இந்திய தொழிலாளர்கள் பெருமளவில் இருக்கிறார்கள். செப்டம்பர்  9 2011-இல் சில அரபிக்  Terrorist  அமெரிக்காவில் பாம் வைத்த விஷயம் எல்லோருக்கும் தெரியும், அப்போதிலிருந்து அமெரிக்காவும் சவூதி அரேபியாவிற்கும் இடையே உள்ள Relationship கெட்டு விட்டது. ஆதலால் சவூதி அரேபியாவிற்கு வெள்ளைக்காரர்கள் வேலை செய்ய தயாராக இல்லை. சவூதி அரேபியாவிற்கு மூல ஆதாரமான பூமியிலிருந்து வரும் எண்ணையும் , அதற்க்கு உதவிகரமாக இருக்கின்ற இன்ஜினீயர்களும் தேவை. இதற்கு இந்தியர்கள் தானே குறைவான சம்பளத்திற்கு வேலை செய்கிறார்கள்.
திரு மோடி  சவூதி அரேபிய போய் இருந்த  பொழுது இந்த குறிப்பிகளை அவர்களின் ராஜாவிடம் சொல்லி பல சலுகைகளை வாங்கி கொடுத்திருக்கிறார்.  சவுதிஅரேபியா பாகிஸ்தானுக்கு SUPPORT பண்றதையே விட்டு விட்டார்கள்.
திரு மோடி  யும் அமெரிக்காவின் PRESIDENT ஒபாமா வும் நல்ல நட்புறவு கொண்டு இருக்கிறார்கள். ஆதலால் அமெரிக்கா நாடு பாரதத்திற்கு விரோதமான காரியங்களை செய்வதை கைவிட்டு விட்டது .அமெரிக்காவின் பெரிய  பெரிய கம்பெனிகளில் உயர் அதிகாரிகள் பலர் இந்தியர்களாக இருக்கின்றார்கள். பாரதத்தின் software export-  யும் பாரதத்தின் திடகாத்திரமான பொருளாதாரத்தையும் தற்பொழுது அமெரிக்காவில் நல்ல விதத்தில் எதிரொலிக்கிறது.


United national- லில் உயர்ந்த கமிட்டி அதன் பெயர்   (UN Security Council) அதில் ஐந்து நாடுகள்  உறுப்பினர்கள் அமெரிக்கா, பிரிட்டன், ஜப்பான், ஜெர்மனி, பிரான்ஸ், அதில் மேலும் ஒரு  நாடு சுழற்சி முறையில்  உறுப்பினர் ஆக்கப்படுவார்கள்.  அந்த Security  Council  லில் உறுப்பினர் ஆவதற்கு பாரதம் முயற்சி செய்து தோற்று விட்டது. ஏனென்றால் பிரான்ஸ் என்ற நாடு நாம் வருவதை தடுத்து கொண்டு இருந்தது. அந்த பிரான்சின் வாயை அடக்கி விட்டார். பாரதத்தின் பக்கம் அவர்களை திருப்பி விட்டார் எப்படி ? பிரான்ஸ் தயாரிக்கும் Rafael என்ற ஆயுத விமானத்தை பெருமளவில் வாங்கி பிரான்சின் வாயை அடைத்து விட்டார்.
குறிப்பு: Rafael விமானத்தை வாங்கியதில் திரு மோடி  தனக்கும் தன் உறவினர்களுக்கும் கமிஷன் பேசவில்லை
திரு மோடி   ஆப் பிரிக்க கண்டத்தில் உள்ள எல்லா நாடுகளையும் டெல்லிக்கு அழைத்தார். அவர்களுக்கு மாநாடு  வைத்து பாரதத்தின் உதவியும் வலிமையும் காண்பித்தார். எல்லா ஆப்ரிக்க நாடுகளுக்கும் அவரவர்களுடைய தேவைக்கு தகுந்தாற் போல் உதவி செய்ய ஒப்பந்தம் பண்ணி விட்டார் . ஆதலால் இப்பொழுது பாரதத்திற்கு அரபிக் கடலில் எந்த ஆப்ரிக்க நாடுகளும் தொந்தரவு பண்ணாது.
தற்பொழுது பாகிஸ்தானில் நடக்க போகும் மாநாட்டை திரு மோடி செய்த புது புது தோழர்கள் (பூடான், பங்களாதேஷ், ஆப்கானிஸ்தான்) அவர்களின் உதவியால் அந்த மாநாட்டை ஒன்றும் இல்லாமல் ஆக்கிவிட்டார்.
இவ்வளவு காரியங்களையும் இரண்டு வருட காலத்தில் செய்து விட்டார்
இப்பொழுது புரிகிறதா
பாகிஸ்தான் பாரதம் கா ஷ்மீரில் பாரத ராணுவம் தாக்கிய பொழுது பாகிஸ்தான் ஏன் எதிர்ப்பு செய்யவில்லை. ஆம் பாரதம் தாக்கி இருக்கிறது என்று சொன்னால் அவர்களிடத்தில் Terrorist இருக்கிறார்கள் என்று ஒத்துக் கொள்வதாய் ஆகிவிடும் இல்லை என்றால் பாகிஸ்தான் ராணுவத்தின் மனோதைரியம் உடைந்து விடும்.
இந்த மாதிரி காரியங்களை செய்வதற்கு அறிவு வேண்டும் , சக்தி வேண்டும் விடா முயற்சி  வேண்டும் , நாட்டு பற்று வேண்டும், கடினமான உழைப்பு வேண்டும் மனோதைரியம் வேண்டும் & character சுத்தமாக இருக்க வேண்டும். இந்த குணங்கள் வேறு எந்த தலைவர்களிடம் இருக்கிறது?


ஏ. சி ரூமில் படுத்து கொண்டு வெத்தலைப்பாக்கு தின்று கொண்டு பெரிய வயிற்றை தடவி கொண்டிருக்கும் வீரர்களுக்கு இவ்வளவு திறமை கிடையாது.
இந்த நாட்டை காப்பாற்றுவதற்கு ஒரு சாதாரண நல்ல தாயின் பிள்ளை திருமதி ஹீரா வின் பிள்ளை மாவீரன் திரு மோடி  அவர்களே போதும். இப்பேற்பட்ட பாரதத்தின் பிள்ளையை வணங்குங்கள் , 
இப்பேற்பட்ட உயர்ந்த மனிதனுக்கு கை கொடுங்கள். எதுவுமே முடியாவிட்டால் பரவாயில்லை அவரை மட்டும் கேவலப் படுத்தாதீர்கள்

02/11/16, 8:15 PM - natarajan ramu: MOHAMED IBRAHIM:
கேரளாவில் நடந்த ஒரு சம்பவத்தின் மொழிபெயர்ப்பு.

போகும் வழியில் ஒரு மின்கம்பத்தில் ஒரு சிறு துண்டு காகிதம் எழுதி தொங்க விட பட்டிருந்தது. அப்படி என்னதான் அதில் எழுதியிருக்கு என்ற ஆர்வத்தில் நானும் போய் படித்தேன்.
அதில் " என்னுடைய 50 ரூபாய் தொலைந்து விட்டது. யார் கைலாவது கிடைத்தால் தயவுது செய்து இந்த விலாசத்தில் தருமாறு கேட்டு கொள்கிறேன். எனக்கு கண் பார்வை அவ்வளவு சரியில்லை" என்று விலாசத்துடன் எழுதியிருந்தது.

எனக்கும் பொழுது போகவில்லை, அந்த குறுக்கு வழியில் பார்த்த ஒரு நபரிடம் விலாசம் கூறி வழி கேட்டேன். "இந்த அம்மாவா, கொஞ்சம் தூரம் போனால் ஓர் பழைய வீடு இருக்கும். அங்க தான் அந்த கண் தெரியாத அம்மா இருக்கு" 

அங்கே ஓர் சிறிய கீத்து .கொட்டகை. ஒரு நாள் மழைக்கு கூட தாங்காது. வெளியில் , கண்கள் குழி விழுந்து, எலும்பும் தோலுமாக வயதான ஓர் அம்மா . என் காலடி சத்தம் கேட்டதும், யாருப்பா நீ? அம்மா நான் இந்த வழியாக வந்தேன், எனக்கு 50 ரூபா கீழே விழுந்து கிடைத்தது. அது உங்களிடம் தரலாம் என்று வந்தேன். கேட்டதும் அந்த அம்மா அழ ஆரம்பித்து விட்டார். தம்பி ரெண்டு நாளா கிட்டத்தட்ட முப்பது முப்பத்தஞ்சு பேர்  வந்து 50 ரூபா கீழே விழுந்து கிடைச்சது  என்று சொல்லி குடுத்துட்டு போறாங்க.. அந்த கடிதம் நான் எழுதவில்லை.எனக்கு எழுத படிக்க தெரியாது. பரவாயில்ல அம்மா நீங்க வச்சிக்கிங்க என்று சொல்லி கொடுத்து திரும்பினேன்.  தம்பி நீ போகும் போது மின்கம்பத்தில் இருக்கும் அந்த கடிதத்தே மறக்காமல் கிழித்து போட்டு விடு என்று அறிவுரைத்தாள் அந்த தாய். 

என் மனதில் வித விதமான எண்ணங்கள். யார் அந்த கடிதத்தை எழுதி இருப்பார். அந்த கடித்ததே கிழித்து விடு என்று அந்த அம்மா ஒவொருவரிடமும் கூறி கொண்டுதான் இருப்பார். ஆனால் யாரும் அப்படி செய்யவில்லை.  யாரும் இல்லாமல் அனாதையாக வாழும் ஓர் உயிருக்கு கடித வடிவில் உதவி செய்த அந்த நண்பருக்கு மனத்தால் நன்றி சொல்லி கொண்டேன். நன்மை செய்யவேண்டும் என்ற மனம் இருந்தால் அதற்க்கு ஆயிரம் வழி.

மனதில் யோசித்து கொண்டே வரும்போது வழியில் ஒருவர் என்னிடம். " அண்ணே இந்த விலாசம் எங்கே என்று சொல்ல முடியுமா? கீழே இருந்து  50 ரூபாய் கிடைத்தது. அந்த அம்மா கிட்டே குடுக்கணும். வழி சொல்றீங்களா?

மனித நேயம் சாகவில்லை.❤️MMI-PDKT❤️

07/11/16, 2:28 PM - natarajan ramu: அது ஒரு வானம் வஞ்சம் தீர்த்த வறண்ட கிராமம்! 

பல குடும்பங்கள் ஊரை காலிசெய்துவிட்டு நகரத்தார் வாகனங்களுக்கு ரோடு போட சாலையோரமாய் குடிபெயர்ந்துவிட்டார்கள்! 
ஊரை விட்டு பிரிய மனமில்லாமல் ஊரோடு ஒட்டிக்கொண்ட ஒரு சில குடும்பங்களில் ராமசாமியின் குடும்பமும் ஒன்று! 

ராமசாமிக்கு மூன்று பிள்ளைகள்! இது தவிர ஒரு ஒரு தாய் ஆடும் இரண்டு ஆட்டுக்குட்டிகளும் இருக்கின்றன, அதோடு நான்கு முருங்கை மரங்களும் இருக்கின்றன! ஆடும் குட்டிகளும் வருடாந்திர செலவுகளுக்கும், முருங்கை மரங்கள் வாராந்திர செலவுகளுக்கும் உதவுகின்றன! சீசன் வரும்போது ஐந்து கிலோ பத்து கிலோ என்று காய்க்கின்ற முருங்கைகள் மற்ற நாட்களில் ஒரு கிலோ இரண்டு கிலோவோடு நிறுத்திக்கொள்ளும்! 

எவ்வளவு வந்தாலும் பையில் நிரப்பி தோளில் வைத்துக்கொண்டால் ஒன்பது கிலோமீட்டருக்கு அப்பால் இருக்கும் டவுன் வரை நடந்து சென்றே ரெகுலராக ஒரு மளிகை கடையில் விற்றுவிட்டு வருவது ராமசாமியின் வழக்கம்! முருங்கை காயை கொடுத்துவிட்டு அதற்கு பதிலாக அரிசி பருப்பு சர்க்கரை போன்ற வீட்டுக்கு தேவையான பொருட்களை வாங்கி வருவார்!
ராமசாமி கொண்டுவரும் முருங்கைக்காயின் சுவை அந்த பகுதி மக்களிடையே மிகவும் பிரபலம்! இதை பயன்படுத்தி மற்ற முருங்கைக்காயோடு கலந்து மளிகை கடைக்காரரும் நல்ல லாபம் சம்பாதித்து விடுவார்! 

பல வருடமாக ராமசாமி முருங்கைக்காய் கொண்டுவருவதால் மளிகை கடைக்காரர் அதை எடை போட்டு பார்த்ததில்லை, ராமசாமி சொல்கின்ற எடையை அப்படியே நம்பி அதற்கு ஈடான மளிகை பொருட்களை கொடுத்து அனுப்புவார்! காரணம் ராமசாமியின் நேர்மையும் நாணயமும் எல்லோரும் அறிந்தது! 

ஒரு நாள் ராமசாமி பத்து கிலோ முருங்கைக்காயை கொடுத்துவிட்டு அதற்கான பொருட்களை வாங்கிச்செல்ல, சிறிது நேரத்தில் பத்து கிலோ முருங்கைக்காய் மொத்தமாய் வேண்டும் என்று ஒரு சமையல்காரர் வந்து கேட்க, அவருக்காக மளிகைக்காரர் எடைபோட அதில் ஒன்பது கிலோ மட்டுமே இருந்தது!

அன்று முழுவதும் மளிகைகாரருக்கு தூக்கமே வரவில்லை! ராமசாமி மீது எவ்வளவு நம்பிக்கை வைத்திருந்தோம், இவ்வளவு பெரிய நம்பிக்கை துரோகத்தை செய்துவிட்டாரே, 

இத்தனை வருடங்களுக்காக இப்படி முட்டாள்தனமாக எடை குறைவான முருங்கைக்காயை வாங்கி ஏமாந்து விட்டோமே, அடுத்த முறை ராமசாமி வந்தால் சும்மா விடக்கூடாது என்று கடுங்கோபத்தில் இருந்தார்! நான்கு நாட்கள் கழித்து ராமசாமி மிகவும் சந்தோஷமாக வந்தார்! நல்ல விளைச்சல் என்பதால் நிறைய கொண்டு வந்திருந்தார்! கையும் களவுமாக பிடிக்கவேண்டும் என்று, எத்தனை கிலோ என்று மளிகைக்காரர் கேட்க பத்து கிலோ என்றார்! அவர் முன்னாலேயே எடைபோட்டு பார்க்க ஒன்பது கிலோ தான் இருந்தது, வந்த கோபத்தில் மளிகைக்காரர் பளார் என ராமசாமியின் கன்னத்தில் அறைந்தார்! இத்தனை வருஷமா இப்படித்தான் ஏமாத்திட்டு இருக்கியா, கிராமத்துக்காரங்க ஏமாத்த மாட்டாங்கன்னு நம்பி தானே எடை போடாம அப்படியே வாங்கினேன், இப்படி துரோகம் பண்ணிட்டியே சீய் என துப்ப, நிலைகுலைந்து போன ராமசாமி, அய்யா மன்னிச்சிடுங்க நான் ரொம்ப ஏழை, எடைக்கல்லு வாங்குற அளவுக்கு என்கிட்ட காசு இல்ல, ஒவ்வொரு முறையும் 
-------------------------------------------------------
நீங்க கொடுக்கிற ஒரு கிலோ பருப்பை ஒரு தட்டுலயும், இன்னொரு தட்டுல முருங்கைக்காயையும் வச்சி 
-------------------------------------------------------
தான் எடைபோட்டு கொண்டுவருவேன் இதை தவிர வேற எதுவும் தெரியாதுங்கய்யா, என்று காலை பிடித்து அழ, 

மளிகைக்காரருக்கு செருப்பால் அடித்தது போல் இருந்தது! 
தான் செய்த துரோகம் தனக்கே வந்ததை உணர்ந்தார்! 

இத்தனை வருடங்களாக ராமசாமியை ஏமாற்ற நினைத்த மளிகைக்காரரும் அவருக்கே தெரியாமல் ஏமாந்து கொண்டுதான் இருந்திருக்கிறார் என்பது தெளிவானது! 

இது தான் உலகநியதி! 

நாம் எதை தருகிறோமோ அதுதான் நமக்கு திரும்ப வரும் நல்லதை தந்தால் நல்லது வரும், தீமையை தந்தால் தீமை வரும்! வருகின்ற காலங்கள் வேண்டுமானால் தாமதமாகலாம், ஆனால் நிச்சயம் வரும்! ஆகவே நல்லதை மட்டுமே தருவோம், நல்லதை மட்டுமே விதைப்போம்!!
07/11/16, 2:29 PM - natarajan ramu: 👁👁😳👁👁அருமையான 👁தகவல் கீழே கொடுக்கப் பட்டுள்ளது. அனைவருக்கும் பயன்படும். தவறாது படியுங்கள். 👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁      கண் குறைபாடுகள், கண்ணாடி அணிவதிலிருந்து விடுதலை – அமைதியாய் ஒரு புரட்சி
👁👁👁👁👁👁👁
என் 9 வயது குழந்தைக்கு இடது கண்ணில் பார்வை குறைபாடு இருப்பது சமீபத்தில் தான் தெரிய வந்தது. வலது கண்ணை கைகளால் மூடிக் கொண்டு மற்றொரு கண்ணால் 10 அடி தூரத்தில் இருக்கும் எழுத்துக்களை படிக்கவைத்துப் பார்த்த போது அவனால் படிக்க முடியவில்லை. ஆனால் அதே இடது கண்ணை கைகளால் மூடிக் கொண்டு வலது கண்ணால் 20 அடி தூரத்தில் இருக்கும் எழுத்துக்களை படிக்க முடிகிறது. இரண்டு கண்களாலும் பார்க்கும் போது இந்த குறைபாடு தெரியவதில்லை. ஆனால் பள்ளியிலே கரும்பலகையில் எழுதும் வரிகளைப் படிக்கும்போது சிரமப் படுகின்றனர். ஆனால் அதை அவர்கள் சொல்வதில்லை. எல்லோருக்கும் இப்படித்தான் இருக்கும் என்று நினைத்துவிடுகின்றனர்.


ஈரோட்டில் உள்ள மிகப் பெரிய கண் மருத்துவமணையில் பரிசோதித்த போது, நிரந்தரமாக கண்ணாடி அணிய வேண்டும் என்று சொல்லிவிட்டனர். கண்ணாடியும் வாங்கி கொடுத்துவிட்டேன்.

அடுத்த சில நாட்களில், என்னுடைய பள்ளித் தோழர் ஒருவரை சந்தித்தேன். பள்ளி நாட்களிலேயே பெரிய சோடாபுட்டிக் கண்ணாடி அணிந்திருந்தார். -6 என்ற அளவில் கண் பார்வைக் குறை அவருக்கு இருந்தது. ஆனால் நான் சந்தித்த அன்று கண் கண்ணாடி அணியாமல், பைக் ஓட்டிவந்ததை பார்த்தவுடன் மிகவும் ஆச்சரியமடைந்தேன்.

என்னப்பா, கண்ணாடி போடாத உன்னை அடையாளமே தெரியவில்லை…கண்களுக்கான அறுவைசிகிச்சை செய்து கொண்டாயா? அல்லது காண்டாக்ட் லென்ஸ்ஸா? என்று கேட்டேன்.

பாண்டிச்சேரி அரவிந்தர் ஆசிரமத்தில் கண்பார்வை குறை பாடுகளை நீக்க பயிற்சி அளிக்கின்றனர். அதில் போய் பயிற்சி பெற்று வந்தேன். கடந்த இரண்டு மூன்று வருடங்களாக கண்ணாடி அணிவதில்லை என்றதை கேட்டதும் ஆச்சரியப்பட்டுப் போனேன்.

அவரிடம் மேலும் தகவல்களை வாங்கிக் கொண்டு இளவலை அழைத்துக் கொண்டு பாண்டிச்சேரி வந்து சேர்ந்தேன்.

பாண்டிச்சேரி, கடற்கரை சாலையின், வடக்கு மூலையில், வட்டாட்சியர் அலுவலகத்திற்கு எதிரில் இந்த பள்ளி அமைந்திருக்கிறது.

திங்கட்கிழமை மதியம் 12 மணியளவில் அந்த பள்ளிக்குச் சென்றேன். அப்பள்ளிக்கு ஒவ்வொரு திங்கட்கிழமையும் விடுமுறை. ஞாயிற்றுக் கிழமை வேலை செய்கிறார்கள். எனவே மறுநாள் காலை 8 மணிக்கு வரச்சொன்னார்கள். இந்த பயிற்சி வகுப்பில் கலந்து கொண்டு பயிற்சி பெற எந்த கட்டணமும் வசூலிப்பதில்லை, நாம் விருப்பப்பட்டு கொடுக்கும் நன்கொடையை மட்டும் ஏற்றுக் கொள்வதாகவும் தெரிவிக்கப் பட்டது.

விடுமுறை தினமாக இருந்த போதும், அங்கிருந்த ஒரு உதவியாளர், எங்கே தங்கியிருக்கிறீர்கள்? என்று கேட்டார். இனிதான், ஏதாவது ஹோட்டலில் அறை எடுக்க வேண்டும் என்றேன். அவசியமில்லை, ஆசிரமத்தின் விடுதியில் தங்கிக் கொள்ளுங்கள் என்று கூறி ஆசிரம விடுதியின் தொலைபேசி எண்ணை கொடுத்தார்.

அழகான தனியறை. குளியலறை இணைந்த, இரண்டு படுக்கைகள், கொண்ட அந்த அறைக்கு வாடகை நாள் ஒன்றுக்கு ரூ.70/- மட்டுமே.

செவ்வாய்கிழமை காலை 8 மணிக்கு அங்கு சென்றேன். ஆரம்ப கட்ட பெயர் பதிவு, பரிசோதனை ஆகியவற்றை முடித்து, பயிற்சி தொடங்கப் பட்டது. சுமார் 2 மணி நேரம் பயிற்சி அளித்தனர்.

கிட்டப் பார்வை, தூரப்பார்வை, போன்ற அனைத்து கண் குறைபாடுகளுக்கும் பயிற்சி அளிக்கின்றனர். நான் சென்ற போது ஹைதராபாத்திலிருந்து ஒரு தம்பதியினர் தங்கள் இரண்டு பெண்குழந்தைகளை அழைத்து வந்திருந்தனர். 8, 4 வயதுடைய அந்த இரண்டு குழந்தைகளும் கண்ணாடி அணிந்திருந்தனர். அக் குழந்தைகளின் தந்தையும் கண்ணாடி அணிந்திருந்தார்.

அவரின் நண்பரின் ஆலோசனையின் பேரில் குழந்தைகளை அழைத்துவந்திருப்பதாக சொன்னார். நேரம் ஆக ஆக, பல குழந்தைகள், நடுத்தரவயதினர், வயதானவர்கள் என்று சுமார் 30 அல்லது 40 பேர்கள் பயிற்ச்சிக்கு வந்திருந்ததை பார்க்க முடிந்தது. இதில் பல வெளிநாட்டவர்களும் அடக்கம்.

செய்வாய் முதல் ஞாயிறுவரை 6 நாட்கள் இப்பயிற்சியை நடத்துகின்றனர். காலை 8 மணிமுதல் 10 மணிவரை, மாலை 3 மணிமுதல் 5 மணிவரை. நாள் ஒன்றுக்கு 4 மணிநேரம் பயிற்சி கொடுக்கின்றனர். முறையான கண் சிமிட்டுதல், தூரத்தில் இருப்பதை படிப்பது, இருட்டு அறையில் மெழுகுவர்த்தியின் வெளிச்சத்தில் சிறு எழுத்துக்களை படிப்பது போன்ற பல பயிற்சிகள். 

ஆச்சரியப் படும் விதமாக, பயிற்சி முடிந்த ஆறாவது நாள் அங்கேயே கண் பரிசோதனை செய்து பார்த்ததில் பார்வையில் நல்ல முன்னேற்றம் தெரிந்தது. தொடர்ந்து ஆறுமாதம் பயிற்சியை தொடருங்கள் பின் கண் பரிசோதனை செய்து பாருங்கள். கண்ணாடி அணிய வேண்டிய அவசியமே வராது என்று பயிற்சியாளர் சொன்னார்.

கடந்த 40 ஆண்டுகளாக இந்த பள்ளி நடப்பதாகவும், இதுவரை ஆயிரக்கணக்கானோர் பயன்பெற்றிருப்பதாகவும் அறிந்து கொண்டேன். முன்கூட்டியே பதிவு செய்து கொண்டு செல்வது நல்லது. மார்ச் முதல் வாரம் முதல் ஜூன் முதல்வாரம் வரையிலான பள்ளிக்கூட விடுமுறை நாட்களில், அதிகமான கூட்டம் வருவதால் அந்த காலகட்டத்தில் செல்ல விரும்புபவர்கள் முன் கூட்டியே பதிவு செய்தால் தான் இடம் கிடைக்கும்.

 ♻♻எட்டு போடுகிறவனுக்கு "நோய்"
எட்டிப் போகும் என்பது ஒரு பழமொழி.♻♻

♻மனித மன, உடல் பிரச்சினைக்கு காரணம்
அவன் கர்மா, அந்த கர்மா வழி உடலுக்கு
வருகிறது "நோய்♻

♻நோய் வருத்தும் பொழுது, வருந்தும் உடல்,
அதிலிருந்து விடுபட்டு நிரந்தர நிம்மதியை
தேடிக் கொள்ளவே விரும்பும்.♻

♻சித்தர் வழி என்பது அனைத்துக்கும்
தெளிவான விடைகளை  தருகிறது.♻

♻சித்தர்கள் :
"எட்டுப் போடு! எல்லாம் பறந்தோடும்!"
என்கிறார்கள்.♻

♻நம்மில் பலரும், நீரிழவு நோய், உயர்
அல்லது தாழ்ந்த ரத்த அழுத்தம்,
மார்புச்சளி போன்றவைகளால் மிக
பாதிப்படைந்திருப்போம்.
எத்தனைதான்
மருந்து சாப்பிட்டாலும் (சாப்பாட்டில்
கட்டுப்பாடு இல்லாமல் போவதால்)
மறுபடியும் இவை தாக்கும்.♻

♻இதிலிருந்து விடுபட்டு, நாம்
மனிதர்கள், நலமாக வாழ வேண்டும்
என்பதற்காக இந்த முறையை வகுத்துக்
கொடுத்துள்ளனர்.♻

♻காலை நேரத்திலோ, அல்லது நேரம்

முதல் 15 நிமிடங்கள் தெற்கிலிருந்து வடக்காக
நடந்தால், அடுத்த 15 நிமிடங்கள்
வடக்கிலிருந்து தெற்காக நடக்க
வேண்டும். இதை ஒரு நாளைக்கு
இருமுறை செய்ய வேண்டும்.♻

♻காலையும், மாலையும் வேளைகள்
மிக வசதியாக இருக்கும்
இதை செய்வதால் என்ன நடக்கும் ♻
 
♻1. பயிற்சி தொடங்கிய அன்றே மார்பு சளி
கரைந்து வெளியேறுவதை காணலாம்.
2. இந்த பயிற்சியை இருவேளை
செய்துவந்தால், உள்ளங்கை கை விரல்கள்
சிவந்திருப்பதை காணலாம். அதாவது
ரத்த ஓட்டத்தை சமன்படுத்துகிறது என்று
அர்த்தம்.
3. நிச்சயம் நீரிழவு நோய் (சர்க்கரை
வியாதி) குறைந்து முற்றிலும்
குணமாகும். (பின்னர் மாத்திரை,
மருந்துகள் தேவை இல்லை).
4. குளிர்ச்சியினால் ஏற்படும் தலைவலி,
மலச்சிக்கல் போன்றவை தீரும்.
5. கண் பார்வை அதிகரிக்கும். ஆரம்ப நிலை
கண்ணாடி அணிவதை தவிர்க்கலாம்.
6. கேட்கும் திறன் அதிகரிக்கும்.
7. உடல் சக்தி பெருகும்- ஆதார சக்கரங்கள்
சரியாக செயல்படும்.
8. குடல் இறக்க நோய் வருவதை தடுக்கும்.
9. ரத்த அழுத்தம் நிச்சயமாக கட்டுப்பாட்டில்
வரும்.
10. பாத வலி, மூட்டுவலி மறையும்.
11. சுவாசம் சீராகும் அதனால் உள்
உருப்புக்கள் பலம் பெரும்.♻

அந்த வடிவம்
"முடிவில்லாதது" மட்டுமல்ல, நமது
ஆதார சக்கரங்களை தட்டி எழுப்பி,               சமநிலை படுத்துகிறது.♻

சித்தர்கள், இதையே "வாசி
யோகத்தில்" (மூச்சு பயிற்சியில்)

எட்டு போடுவார்கள் என்பது தெரியுமோ?

08/11/16, 10:17 AM - natarajan ramu: தேநீர் குடிக்கலாம் :           ( இராணுவ வீரர்களின் ஒரு உண்மை கதை )
நெஞ்சை நெகிழச்செய்யும் ஒரு நிகழ்வு..                    படிக்கவும்..                      நீங்களும் கடவுளாகலாம்...       யாருக்காவது!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ஒரு பதினைந்து இராணுவ வீரர்களும் அக்குழுவின் மேஜரும் இமாலயாவில் 3 மாத காலம் பணி புரிய சென்று கொண்டிருந்தார்கள்..

மிகவும் குளிர்ந்த சீதோஷ்ண நிலையும் , இடை இடையே பனி மழையும் அவர்கள் மலை ஏறுவதை மிகவும் கடினப்படுத்தியது..

இந்த நேரத்தில், யாராவது ஒரு ஒரு கப் தேநீர் கொடுத்தால் எவ்வளவு நன்றாக இருக்கும்.. அந்த மேஜர் மனமும் உடலும் ஆசைப்பட்டது..ஆனால் அது ஒரு வெற்று ஆசை என அறிந்தும்..

அவர்கள் பொருட்படுத்தாமல், ஒரு மணி நேரம் நடக்க, வழியில் ஒரு பாழடைந்த ஒரு சிறிய கடைப்போல் தோற்றம் கொண்ட ஒரு வடிவை கண்டார்கள்.. அது ஒரு தேநீர் கடைப்போலவே இருந்தது..ஆனால் பூட்டால் பூட்டப்பட்டிருந்தது..

"அதிர்ஷ்டம் இல்லை, தேனீர் இல்லை" ஆனாலும் நாம் சில நிமிடம் ஒய்வெடுக்கலாம்..  நாமும் மூன்று மணி நேரம் நடந்து வந்திருக்கோம்...என்றார் மேஜர்..

அதில் ஒரு இராணுவ வீரர் சொன்னார்..சார், இது ஒரு தேனீர் கடை தான்..உள்ளே தேனீர் தயாரிக்க எல்லாம் இருக்கக்கூடும்.  நாம் பூட்டை உடைக்கலாமே...என்றார்..

இது ஒரு தர்மசங்கட நிலை அவர்க்கு.. தன்னுடைய தளர்ந்த வீரர்களுக்கு தேனீர் கொடுக்க பூட்டை உடைப்பதா அல்லது இப்படிப்பட்ட ஒரு தகாத காரியத்தை செய்யாமல் இருப்பதா என்று குழம்பினார்...

சிறிது நேரம் கழித்து, அவர் மனதை விட அவரின் அறிவு ஜெயித்தது.. வீரர்களிடம் பூட்டை உடைக்கச்சொன்னார்..

அவர்களின் அதிர்ஷ்டம், உள்ளே ஒரு தேனீர் தயாரிக்க எல்லாம் இருக்க, பிஸ்கெட் பாக்கெட்டும் இருந்தது..

எல்லோரும் தேனீர் பிஸ்கெட் நன்றாக அனுபவித்து புறப்பட தயாராகினார்கள்..

நாம் இந்த கடையின் பூட்டை உடைத்து தேனீர் பிஸ்கெட் உண்டோம்.. நாம் ஒரு மோசமான திருடர்கள் அல்ல.. இது ஒரு சூழல்.. நாம் இந்த தேசத்தை காக்கும் தேசத்தாயின் பிள்ளைகள்.. 
இப்படிப்பட்ட நினைவு அவரை வந்து இடிக்க, அவர், ஆயிரம் ரூபாயை தன் பர்ஸில் இருந்து எடுத்து, அந்த கவுண்டரில் இருந்த சர்க்கரை டப்பாவின் கீழே வைத்து விட்டு, கதவை மூடி விட்டு, தன் குற்ற உணர்ச்சி துறந்து , புறப்பட்டார்..

அடுத்த மூன்று மாத காலத்தில் அவரின் தலைமையில் வீரர்கள் தீவிர கிளர்ச்சிக்குள்ளாக்கூடிய அந்த இடத்தில் பணியாற்றி, யாருக்கும் உயிர் சேதம் வராமல் இருக்க, அடுத்த குழு வந்து அவர்களை விடுவித்தது..

அதே வழியில் அவர்கள் திரும்ப, அதே தேனீர் கடை,,ஆனால் இப்பொழுது அது திறந்திருந்தது.. அதன் முதலாளியும் இருந்தார்..

ஒரு வயதான அந்த கடை முதலாளி, தீடீரென்று தனக்கு கிடைத்த அந்த பதினாறு விருந்தாளிகளையும் வரவேற்று அமரச்சொன்னார்.

எல்லோரும் தேனீர் பிஸ்கெட் உணடு களித்தனர்.

அந்த வயதானவரிடம், இப்படி ஒரு அத்வான இடத்தில் தேனீர் விற்பது பற்றியும் அவரின் வாழ்க்கை சூழல் பற்றியும் பேசினர்.

அவரிடம் பல அனுபவ கதைகள் இருந்தது.. மிகவும் நிறைந்த நெஞ்சுடன் கடவுள் பக்தியும் இருந்தது..

என் மதிப்பிற்குரிய நண்பர் திரு..சாருஹாசன் போன்ற எண்னம் கொண்ட ஒரு வீரர் கேட்டார்... ஹே தாத்தா... கடவுள் இருக்கிறார் என்பது உண்மை எனில், அவர் எதுக்கு உன்னை இப்படி இங்கே இவ்வளவு வறுமையுடன் வைத்திருக்க வேண்டும்.....என்று...

அப்படி சொல்லாதீர்கள் மகனே..கடவுள் நிச்சயம் இருக்கிறார்..அதற்கு என்னிடம் சான்றே இருக்கு..

மூன்று மாதம் முன்பு, சில தீவிரவாதிகளால், ஒரு விஷயம் தேவைப்பட்டதால் எனது மகன் மிகவும் அதிக தாக்குதலுக்கு உள்ளாக்கப்பட்டான்... 
நான் எனது கடையை மூடிவிட்டு எனது மகனை மருத்துவமனை கூட்டிச்சென்றேன்.. அவர்கள் எழுதிக்கொடுத்த மருந்தை வாங்க என்னிடம் பணம் இல்லை..
தீவிரவாதிகளுக்கு பயந்து யாரும் எனக்கு கடன் கொடுக்கவும் வரவில்லை..
என் நம்பிக்கை ஈற்று போய்விட்டது..
கடவுளிடம் கதறி அழுதேன்.. ஐயா கனவாங்களே , கடவுள் அன்று என்னுடைய கடைக்குள் வந்திருக்கிறார்.. நான் அழுது ஆற்றிக்கொண்டு என் கடையை வந்தடைந்த பொழுது.. என் கடையின் பூட்டு உடைக்கப்பட்டிருந்தது..
நான் முழுதும் போய் விட்டது என்று நினைத்து கலங்கி, பயந்து உடைக்கப்பட்ட பூட்டை விலக்கி உள்ளே சென்று பார்த்தேன்..
அங்கே சர்க்கரை டப்பாவின் கீழே ஆயிரம் ரூபாய் இருந்தது.. 
உங்களுக்கு என்னால் அந்த ஆயிரம் ரூபாயின் மதிப்பை வார்த்தைகளால் சொல்ல இயலாது..
கடவுள் இருக்கிறார்..என்றும் இருக்கிறார்.. இதை விட என்ன சொல்ல..
என்று முடித்தார் அவர்..
அவர் கண்களில் அதற்கான நம்பிக்கை மிளிர்ந்தது..

அந்த பதினைந்து ஜோடிக்கண்களும் அந்த மேஜரின் ஒரு ஜோடிக்கண்களை இப்பொழுது துடிப்புடன் பார்த்தன..
அந்த ஒரு ஜோடிக்கண், எதையும் சொல்லாதீர்கள் என்பதை ஒரு அதிகார ஆணையாக பிறப்பித்ததை அவர்கள் உணர்ந்தார்கள்..

அந்த மேஜர் எழுந்து, எல்லாவற்றிற்கும் பணம் கொடுத்தார்..
அந்த முதியவரை தழுவிக்கொண்டு, ஆம் தாத்தா, எனக்கும் தெரியும்..கடவுள் இருக்கிறார்... தாத்தா... உங்கள் தேனீர் மிக அபாரம்...
இதை அவர் சொல்லும் பொழுது, அவர் கண்களின் ஒரம் படிந்த ஈரத்தை மீதி பதினைந்து ஜோடிக்கண்களும் பார்க்க தவறவில்லை..

இதில் இருக்கும் உண்மை என்ன என்றால்..

நீங்களும் யாருக்காவது கடவுளாகலாம்..
என்பதே.. 

( இது ஒரு இராணுவ வீரரால் சொல்லப்பட்ட உண்மை கதை..                                        மார்க்கம் @ கூப்வாரா செக்டார் காஷ்மீர் பகுதி )

அழுவதை விட             அதிகமாக சிரியுங்கள் !!!! பெறுவதைவிட          அதிகமாக கொடுங்கள் !!!! வெறுப்பதைவிட அதிகமாக நேசியுங்கள் !!!!
08/11/16, 1:04 PM - Vidya Perima: ஒரு பெண் அவளுடைய வீட்டை விட்டு வெளியேறிய பொழுது அப்பொழுது மூன்று முதியவர்கள்  அவள் வீட்டின் முன் அமர்ந்திருந்தார்கள்.

அவர்களைப் பார்த்த அப்பெண் நீங்கள் யாரென்று எனக்கு தெரியவில்லை. இருந்தாலும் உங்களை பார்த்தால் பசியுடன் இருப்பதாக தெரிகிறது. அதனால் என் வீட்டிற்கு வாருங்கள். 

நான் ஏதாவது சாப்பிடுவதற்கு தருகிறேன் என்று அப்பெண் அம்மூவரையும் பார்த்து கூறிகிறாள்.
அதற்கு அம்மூவரும் வீட்டில் உன் கணவன் இருக்கிறாரா என்று கேட்கிறார்கள்.

அதற்கு அவள் அவர் வீட்டில் இல்லை. வெளியே சென்றிருக்கிறார் என்று பதிலளிக்கிறாள் .

அப்பொழுது அவர்கள் அப்படியென்றால் உனது கணவர் வரும் வரை நாங்கள் வரமாட்டோம் என்று கூறிவிடுகிறார்கள்.

மாலையில் அவளுடைய கணவன் வீட்டிற்கு வந்தபொழுது அவள் நடந்தவற்றை கூறுகிறாள். அதற்கு அவள் கணவன் நான் வீட்டிற்கு வந்துவிட்டேன் என்று கூறி அவர்களை அழைத்துக்கொண்டு வா என்று சொல்கிறார்.

அவள் வீட்டிலிருந்து வெளியே வந்து அம்முவரையும் அழைக்கிறாள்..
அதற்கு அவர்கள் நாங்கள் மூவரும் ஒன்றாக வரமுடியாது என்று கூறுகிறார்கள்.
ஏன் அப்படி என்று அவர்களிடம் அவள் கேட்டாள்.

அதற்கு அவர்களில் ஒரு முதியவர் இன்னொருவரை காண்பித்து இவர் செல்வம் என்றும், மற்றொருவரை காண்பித்து இவர் வெற்றி என்றும் நான் அன்பு என்றும் கூறி உள்ளே சென்று உன் கணவனிடம் எங்கள் மூவரில் யார் உன் வீட்டிற்கு வரவேண்டும் என்று ஆலோசனை செய்து எங்களிடம் சொல் என்று அவளிடம் கூறுகிறார்.

அப்பெண் வீட்டினுள் வந்து தன் கணவனிடம் அந்த முதியவர் கூறிய அனைத்தையும் கூறுகிறாள்..
அதை கேட்ட அவளுடைய கணவன் மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சியாகி என்ன ஆச்சர்ரியமாக இருக்கிறது!. என்று கூறிவிட்டு, நாம் நம் வீட்டிற்கு செல்வத்தை அழைப்போம். 

அவர் நம் வீட்டை செல்வத்தால் நிரப்பிவிடுவார் என்று தன் மனைவியிடம் கூறுகிறார்.
அதை கேட்ட அவருடைய மனைவி அதற்கு அதிருப்தி தெரிவிக்கிறாள். 

ஏன் நாம் நம் வீட்டிற்கு வெற்றியை அழைக்கக்கூடாது? என்று கேட்கிறாள்.
இதை அனைத்தையும் செவியேற்று கொண்டிருந்த, வீட்டின் ஒரு மூலையில் அமர்ந்திருந்த அவர்களுடைய மகள், ஏன் நாம் அன்பை அழைக்கக்கூடாது? அவரை அழைத்தால் நம் வீட்டை அன்பால் நிரப்பிவிடுவார் அல்லவா? என்று அவள் தன் கருத்தை கூறுகிறாள்.
இதை கேட்ட அவளுடைய பெற்றோர் தங்களுடைய மகளின் ஆசையின்படி அன்பை வீட்டிற்கு அழைக்க முடிவு செய்கின்றனர். 

பிறகு தன் மனைவியிடம் அவளுடைய கணவன், நீ வெளியே சென்று அன்பை நம் வீட்டிற்கு அழைத்துக் கொண்டுவா என்கிறார்.

அப்பெண் வெளியே வந்து அம்மூவரையும் பார்த்து உங்களில் யார் அன்பு, அவர் என் வீட்டிற்கு விருந்தாளியாக வருமாறு அன்புடன் அழைக்கிறேன் என்கிறாள்.
அதைக் கேட்ட அன்பு வீட்டிற்கு செல்கிறார். 

அவரை பின் தொடர்ந்து மற்ற இருவரும் செல்கின்றனர்.
இதைப் பார்த்த அப்பெண், மற்ற இருவரிடமும் ஏன் நீங்கள் வருகிறீர்கள்?
நான் அழைத்தது அன்பை மட்டும் தானே? என்று ஆச்சர்யப்பட்டு கேட்கிறாள்.

அதற்கு அம்மூவரும் ஒன்றாக அப்பெண்ணிடம், நீ செல்வத்தையோ அல்லது வெற்றியையோ அழைத்திருந்தால், மற்ற இருவரும் வெளியே இருந்திருப்போம். ஆனால் நீ அன்பை அழைத்திருக்கிறாய். எங்கு அன்பு இருக்கிறதோ அங்கு செல்வமும், வெற்றியும் இருக்கும் என்று பதிலளிக்கிறார்கள்!!
அன்புதான் நம்மை அதிக சந்தோஷப்பட வைக்கும்........ 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐இந்த message வேற groupla அனுப்பி பாருங்க. எல்லா ஆடும் இன்னொரு ஆடு கூட ஜோடிய நிற்கும். I also very very shocked.

09/11/16, 12:27 AM - Bharath Cousin: *why RBI is issuing ₹2000 Rupees Notes *

The Rs 2000 currency is designed keeping in mind to eradicate the black money issues using state of the art indigenous nano technology, every Rs. 2000 currency note is embedded with a *NGC (Nano GPS Chip)*

*How the embeded NGC Technology Works?*
The unique feature of the NGC is it dosent need any power source. It only acts as a signal reflector. When a Satellite sends a signal requesting location the NGC reflects back the signal from the location, giving precise location coordinates, and the serial number of the currency back to the satellite, this way every NGC embedded currency can be easily tracked & located even if it is kept 120 meters below ground level. The NGC cant be tampered with or removed without damaging the currency note

*How will this help eradicate black money menace?*
Since every NGC embeded currency can be tracked. The satellite can identify the exact amount of money stored at a certain location. If a relatively high concentration of currency is found a certain location for a longer period of time at suspicious locations other than banks & other financial institutions. The information will be passed on to the Income Tax Department for further investigation

*Just a beginning of the end of black money in India*

14/11/16, 4:18 PM - Pornima Akka: ராம சாமியும் முருங்கை காயும்..
........................................................

"ஒரு கிராமத்தில் ராமசாமி என்பவர் வாழ்ந்து வந்தார்..

அவர் வீட்டுத் தோட்டத்தில் ஒரு முருங்கை மரம் இருந்தது.

வாரம் ஒரு முறை முருங்கை காய்களை பறித்து, பையில் நிரப்பி தோளில் வைத்துக்கொண்டு ஒன்பது கிலோமீட்டருக்கு அப்பால் இருக்கும் டவுன் வரை நடந்து சென்றே ரெகுலராக ஒரு மளிகை கடையில் விற்றுவிட்டு வருவது ராமசாமியின் வழக்கம்!

முருங்கை காயை கொடுத்துவிட்டு அதற்கு பதிலாக அரிசி பருப்பு சர்க்கரை போன்ற வீட்டுக்கு தேவையான பொருட்களை வாங்கி வருவார்!

ராமசாமி கொண்டுவரும் முருங்கைக்காயின் சுவை அந்த பகுதி மக்களிடையே மிகவும் பிரபலம்!

இதை பயன்படுத்தி மற்ற முருங்கைக்காயோடு கலந்து மளிகை கடைக்காரரும் நல்ல லாபம் சம்பாதித்து விடுவார்!

பல வருடமாக ராமசாமி முருங்கைக்காய் கொண்டுவருவதால் மளிகை கடைக்காரர் அதை எடை போட்டு பார்த்ததில்லை;

ராமசாமி சொல்கின்ற எடையை அப்படியே நம்பி அதற்கு ஈடான மளிகை பொருட்களை கொடுத்து அனுப்புவார்!

காரணம் ராமசாமியின் நேர்மையும் நாணயமும் எல்லோரும் அறிந்தது! 

ஒரு நாள் ராமசாமி பத்து கிலோ முருங்கைக்காயை கொடுத்துவிட்டு அதற்கான பொருட்களை வாங்கிச்சென்றார்;

சிறிது நேரத்தில் பத்து கிலோ முருங்கைக்காய் மொத்தமாய் வேண்டும் என்று ஒரு சமையல்காரர் வந்து கேட்க, அவருக்காக மளிகைக்காரர் எடைபோட அதில் ஒன்பது கிலோ மட்டுமே இருந்தது!

அன்று முழுவதும் மளிகைகாரருக்கு தூக்கமே வரவில்லை! ராமசாமி மீது எவ்வளவு நம்பிக்கை வைத்திருந்தோம்,
இவ்வளவு பெரிய நம்பிக்கை துரோகத்தை செய்துவிட்டாரே!

இத்தனை வருடங்களுக்காக இப்படி முட்டாள்தனமாக எடை குறைவான முருங்கைக்காயை வாங்கி ஏமாந்து விட்டோமே!!

அடுத்த முறை ராமசாமி வந்தால் சும்மா விடக்கூடாது என்று கடுங்கோபத்தில் இருந்தார்!

நான்கு நாட்கள் கழித்து ராமசாமி மிகவும் சந்தோஷமாக வந்தார்!

நல்ல விளைச்சல் என்பதால் நிறைய கொண்டு வந்திருந்தார்!

"கையும் களவுமாக பிடிக்கவேண்டும்என்று, எத்தனை கிலோ என்று மளிகைக்காரர் கேட்க பத்து கிலோ என்றார் ராமசாமி..

அவர் முன்னாலேயே எடைபோட்டு பார்க்க ஒன்பது கிலோ தான் இருந்தது.

வந்த கோபத்தில் மளிகைக்காரர் பளார்,பளார் என ராமசாமியின் கன்னத்தில் அறைந்தார்!

இத்தனை வருஷமா இப்படித்தான் ஏமாத்திட்டு இருக்கியா? கிராமத்துக்காரங்க ஏமாத்த மாட்டாங்கன்னு நம்பி தானே எடை போடாம அப்படியே வாங்கினேன்,

இப்படி துரோகம் பண்ணிட்டியே சீய் என துப்ப, நிலைகுலைந்து போனார் ராமசாமி.

அய்யா...என்ன மன்னிச்சிடுங்க நான் ரொம்ப ஏழை, எடைக்கல்லு வாங்குற அளவுக்கு என்கிட்ட காசு இல்லீங்க..

ஒவ்வொரு முறையும் நீங்க கொடுக்கிற ஒரு கிலோ பருப்பை ஒரு தட்டுலயும், இன்னொரு தட்டுல முருங்கைக்காயையும் வச்சி தான் எடைபோட்டு கொண்டுவருவேன்.

"இதை தவிர வேற எதுவும் தெரியாதுங்கய்யா, என்று காலை பிடித்து அழ, மளிகைக்காரருக்கு செருப்பால் அடித்தது போல் இருந்தது"!
  
"தான் செய்த துரோகம் தனக்கே வந்ததை உணர்ந்தார்!

இத்தனை வருடங்களாக ராமசாமியை ஏமாற்ற நினைத்த மளிகைக்காரரும் அவருக்கே தெரியாமல் ஏமாந்து கொண்டுதான் இருந்திருக்கிறார் என்பது தெளிவானது!
இது தான் உலகநியதி!

நாம் எதை தருகிறோமோ அதுதான் நமக்கு திரும்ப வரும் நல்லதை தந்தால் நல்லது வரும், தீமையை தந்தால் தீமை வரும்!

வருகின்ற காலங்கள் வேண்டுமானால் தாமதமாகலாம், ஆனால் நிச்சயம் வரும்!

ஆகவே நல்லதை மட்டுமே தருவோம், நல்லதை மட்டுமே விதைப்போம்!!

1) We'd rather spend more on daughters wedding than on her education 😀

2) We live in a country where seeing a policeman makes us nervous rather than feeling safe 🙊

3) In IAS exam,a person writes a brilliant 1500 words essay about how Dowry is a social evil. Impresses everyone and cracks the exam.
One year later,same person demands a dowry of 1 crore, because he is an IAS officer 😂

4) Indians are very shy and still are 121 Crore 😜

5) Indians are obsessed with screen guards on their smartphones even though most come with scratch proof Gorilla Glass,but never bother wearing a helmet while riding their bikes 😀

6) Indian Society teaches
'Not to Get Raped', rather 'Don't Rape'  😜

7) Reserved people get more benefit than deserve people...! 😭

8) The worst movies earn the most 😁

9) A porn-star is accepted in society as a celebrity,but a rape victim is not even accepted as a normal human being 😡

10) Politicians Divide us,Terrorists Unite us 👍

11) Everyone is in a hurry,but no one reaches on time 😃

12) Priyanka Chopra earned more money playing Mary Kom, than Mary Kom earned in her entire career 😂

13) Its dangerous to talk to strangers,but it's perfectly ok to marry one 😀

14) Most people who fight over Gita and Quran,have probably never read any of them 😀

15)The shoes we wear are sold in air Conditioned showrooms,the vegetables we eat are sold on the footpath 👟👠👡👢👞

18/11/16, 10:24 AM - natarajan ramu: *MIND BLOWING RESPONSE FROM INTERNATIONAL MEDIA TO DEMONETIZATION! IT WILL SHUT THE MOUTH OF OPPOSITION!*

This is how international media responded to india’s currency ban which shows the impact of this historic decision over world economy and how it is going to stop corruption and black money in india! IMF, European Union, World Bank and every reputed international organisations supported this move, World bank president even said, I am a big fan of Modi!

Forbes: Five days after the decision, Forbes has published an article titled “India’s Great Bank Note Switch Appears To Be Working – $30 Billion In Rs Deposited In Banks.” The article notes that a move of this magnitude would result in “obvious chaos”, but points that “so far at least it looks as if it is working.” The article goes on to call the scheme “rather well done, a clever plan.”

New York Times: A New York Times quoted an expert saying it was a wise move. “The plan, top secret until Mr. Modi’s announcement, was hailed by financial analysts as bold and potentially transformational for India. It is also a high-stakes experiment,” the article said.

Washington Post: It called PM Narendra Modi’s initiative as ‘ambitious’ and in keeping with his election time vow to initiate a crackdown against black money. The Post said black money in India ‘is estimated to total from $400 billion to more than $1 trillion’.

The Independent: This Singapore-based paper published a glowing article on the move titled “Modi does a Lee Kuan Yew to stamp out corruption in India.” Lee Kuan Yew was the Singaporean Prime Minister for several decades and is considered the architect of modern Singapore. “Government leaders feel that the sudden move by the Indian Prime Minister has brought new respect for him.

Bloomberg: In an article published in leading American financial journal Bloomberg, Swiss global financial services company UBS Group AG said that Australia should follow India’s lead and scrap its biggest bank notes.

“Removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks,” UBS analysts led by Jonathan Mott said in a note to clients on Monday. Benefits would include reduced crime and welfare fraud, increased tax revenue and a “spike” in bank deposits.

A senior Indian government official even equated Mr Modi to Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. From making up his mind to rolling it out on 8 Nov, a new Lee Kuan Yew is born in India. It will be reflected in the legacy of this Prime Minister,”.

_*OUR HUMBLE REQUEST TO READERS- PLEASE SHARE THIS NEWS WITH OUR COUNTRY MEN, LET PEOPLE KNOW THE REALITY AND HOW WORLD SEES THIS DECISION!*_

He wanted to marry a seventh time.....

But there was no women willing, because of his reputation. 

Finally one woman came forward.....

She too had married 6 times and each of her husbands had died soon after the marriages.

People were curious to know what would happen when these two got married to each other. 

The wedding took place and the very next day.......

Guys....from a very reliable source. 

The financial year will shift to Jan- Dec instead of April-March.

Announcement will be made on 30th December

 There is a strong possibility that Government may scrap Income Tax from FY 2017-18 and replace with Banking Transaction Tax (BTT). 

From 1st April 2017 possibility of only two taxes 
1. Direct Tax as BTT and 
2.  GST as indirect Tax.

21/11/16, 11:04 AM - natarajan ramu: வங்கித் திருவிளையாடல்.


கஸ்டமர்: இந்த ஆள்  கொண்டுவந்த செக்கிற்கு பணம் இல்லையென்று சொன்னவன் எவன்?

மேனேஜர்: அவன் இவனென்ற ஏகவசனம் வேண்டாம். அவையடக்கதுடன் கேட்டால் அதற்குத் தக்க பதில் கூறுவார்கள். 

கஸ்டமர்: அப்படியானால் மேனேஜரை விட மற்றவருக்கு இங்கு அதிகாரமோ?

மேனேஜர்: இது நார்மல் பேங்கிங் நாள் அன்று. ஸ்பெஷல் வர்கிங் டே. இன்று எல்லாருக்கும் சம உரிமை உண்டு. 

கஸ்டமர்: அதனால்தான் இவன் கொண்டு வந்த செக்கிற்கு பணம் தரமாட்டோம் என்றீர்களோ?

கேஷியர்: ஆம். பழுதுள்ள செக் என்பதால்  பணம் பெற அருகதையில்லை என்று கூறியவன் நான்தான். 

கஸ்டமர்: யார் இந்தப் பரட்டை?

மேனேஜர்: இந்தக் கிளையின் தலைமை கேஷியர் மிஸ்டர் பரட்டையார். 

கஸ்டமர்: ஆ! பரட்டை! கிளையின் காசாளர் என்ற ஆணவத்திலேதான் செக்கிலே குறை கண்டீரோ? என்ன குற்றம் கண்டீர்?

கேஷியர்: முதற்கண் செக்கில் கையெழுத்து இட்டது யார்? அதற்கு பதில் தேவை. 

கஸ்டமர்: யாம்! யாம்! கையெழுத்திட்டோம்.

கேஷியர்: கையெழுத்திட நீர் வராமல் அதை இன்னொருவரிடம் கொடுத்து அனுப்பியதற்கு காரணம்?

கஸ்டமர்: அது நடந்து முடிந்த கதை. தொடங்கிய பிரச்சனைக்கு வாரும். 

கேஷியர்: கஸ்டமருக்கு முதலில் பொய்யுரை தேவையில்லை. அதை நீங்கள் புரிந்துகொள்ள வேண்டும். 

கஸ்டமர்: புரிந்தது புரியாதது தெரிந்தது தெரியாதது அனைத்தும் யாம் அறிவோம். அதுபற்றி உமது அட்வைஸ் நாட் நெஸஸரி.  ஐ நோ எவ்ரிதிங்.

கேஷியர்: எல்லாம் தெரிந்துவிட்டால் செக்கில் பிழை இருக்காதென்று அர்த்தமா? அதுபற்றி நாம் குற்றம் கூறக்கூடாதா?

கஸ்டமர்: பரட்டை! என் செக்கில் குற்றம் கூறுகிறாராம்! கூறும். கூறும். கூறிப் பாரும். 

மேனேஜர்: சார்! சாந்தமாக பேசுங்கள். செக் பற்றிய டிஸ்கஷன் தேவைதான். ஆனால் அது சண்டையாக மாறிவிடக்கூடாது. 

கஸ்டமர்: சண்டையும் சச்சரவும் பேங்கர் கஸ்டமர்களின் பரம்பரைச் சொத்து அதை மாற்ற யாராலும் இயலாது. சற்று பொறுத்திருந்து பாரும்! பரட்டையாரே  எமது செக்கில் எங்கு குறை கண்டீர்? கையெழுத்திலா? இல்லை அமௌன்ட் இன் வர்ட்ஸிலா?

கேஷியர்: கையெழுத்தில் குற்றமில்லை. இருந்தாலும் மேனேஜ் பண்ணிக்கொள்ளலாம். எழுதிய அமௌன்ட்டில் தான் குற்றம் உள்ளது. எங்கே நீர் எழுதிய அமௌண்டை இன்னொரு முறை கூறும்.

கஸ்டமர்: ஹா! இரண்டு நான்கு ஸைபர் ஸைபர் ஸைபர்... இருபத்து நான்காயிரம். 

கேஷியர்: இதனால் நீர் சொல்ல வந்தது?

கஸ்டமர்: இதுகூடத் தெரியவில்லையா தலைமை கேஷியருக்கு? இட் மீன்ஸ் ஐ நீட் ட்வென்டி போர் தௌசன்ட் ருப்பீஸ்..

கேஷியர்: ஆனால் உங்கள் அக்கௌண்டில் இருந்து நீங்கள் ஏற்கனேவே ATM  மூலம் 2500 எடுத்திருப்பதால் தற்போது 24000 ரூபாய்கள் தரவியலாது. இதுதான் எமது தீர்ப்பு. 

கஸ்டமர்: குழந்தையின் ஸ்கூலுக்கு பீஸ் கட்ட வேண்டும் என்று வருபவனுக்கும் இதே தீர்ப்புதானா?

கேஷியர்: ஆமாம் இதே தீர்ப்புதான். 

கஸ்டமர்: உங்கள் சொந்தக்காரர் நண்பர்களுக்கு இதே தீர்ப்புத்தானா?

கேஷியர்: ஆமாம்.

கஸ்டமர்: உங்கள் பிராஞ்ச் மேனேஜருக்கு?

கேஷியர்: அவரென்ன, எங்கள் சென்னை மண்டலத்தை நிர்வகிக்கும் ஜெனெரல் மேனஜருக்கும் இதே பதில்தான். 

கஸ்டமர்: மிஸ்டர் பரட்டை! நன்றாகப் பாரும்! இந்த ID கார்டை பாரும்! இப்போதும் அதே பதில்தானா?

கேஷியர்: நீரே இந்த வங்கியின் புதிய சேர்மன் ஆகுக. IDயைக் காட்டினாலும் குற்றம் குற்றமே!

23/11/16, 12:34 PM - Paiya perrippa: 😆வங்கித் திருவிளையாடல்🤔

கஸ்டமர்: இந்த ஆள்  கொண்டுவந்த செக்கிற்கு பணம் இல்லையென்று சொன்னவன் எவன்?

மேனேஜர்: அவன் இவனென்ற ஏகவசனம் வேண்டாம். அவையடக்கதுடன் கேட்டால் அதற்குத் தக்க பதில் கூறுவார்கள். 

கஸ்டமர்: அப்படியானால் மேனேஜரை விட மற்றவருக்கு இங்கு அதிகாரமோ?

மேனேஜர்: இது நார்மல் பேங்கிங் நாள் அன்று. ஸ்பெஷல் வர்கிங் டே. இன்று எல்லாருக்கும் சம உரிமை உண்டு. 

கஸ்டமர்: அதனால்தான் இவன் கொண்டு வந்த செக்கிற்கு பணம் தரமாட்டோம் என்றீர்களோ?

கேஷியர்: ஆம். பழுதுள்ள செக் என்பதால்  பணம் பெற அருகதையில்லை என்று கூறியவன் நான்தான். 

கஸ்டமர்: யார் இந்தப் பரட்டை?

மேனேஜர்: இந்தக் கிளையின் தலைமை கேஷியர் மிஸ்டர் பரட்டையார். 

கஸ்டமர்: ஆ! பரட்டை! கிளையின் காசாளர் என்ற ஆணவத்திலேதான் செக்கிலே குறை கண்டீரோ? என்ன குற்றம் கண்டீர்?

கேஷியர்: முதற்கண் செக்கில் கையெழுத்து இட்டது யார்? அதற்கு பதில் தேவை. 

கஸ்டமர்: யாம்! யாம்! கையெழுத்திட்டோம்.

கேஷியர்: கையெழுத்திட நீர் வராமல் அதை இன்னொருவரிடம் கொடுத்து அனுப்பியதற்கு காரணம்?

கஸ்டமர்: அது நடந்து முடிந்த கதை. தொடங்கிய பிரச்சனைக்கு வாரும். 

கேஷியர்: கஸ்டமருக்கு முதலில் பொய்யுரை தேவையில்லை. அதை நீங்கள் புரிந்துகொள்ள வேண்டும். 

கஸ்டமர்: புரிந்தது புரியாதது தெரிந்தது தெரியாதது அனைத்தும் யாம் அறிவோம். அதுபற்றி உமது அட்வைஸ் நாட் நெஸஸரி.  ஐ நோ எவ்ரிதிங்.

கேஷியர்: எல்லாம் தெரிந்துவிட்டால் செக்கில் பிழை இருக்காதென்று அர்த்தமா? அதுபற்றி நாம் குற்றம் கூறக்கூடாதா?

கஸ்டமர்: பரட்டை! என் செக்கில் குற்றம் கூறுகிறாராம்! கூறும். கூறும். கூறிப் பாரும். 

மேனேஜர்: சார்! சாந்தமாக பேசுங்கள். செக் பற்றிய டிஸ்கஷன் தேவைதான். ஆனால் அது சண்டையாக மாறிவிடக்கூடாது. 

கஸ்டமர்: சண்டையும் சச்சரவும் பேங்கர் கஸ்டமர்களின் பரம்பரைச் சொத்து அதை மாற்ற யாராலும் இயலாது. சற்று பொறுத்திருந்து பாரும்! பரட்டையாரே  எமது செக்கில் எங்கு குறை கண்டீர்? கையெழுத்திலா? இல்லை அமௌன்ட் இன் வர்ட்ஸிலா?

கேஷியர்: கையெழுத்தில் குற்றமில்லை. இருந்தாலும் மேனேஜ் பண்ணிக்கொள்ளலாம். எழுதிய அமௌன்ட்டில் தான் குற்றம் உள்ளது. எங்கே நீர் எழுதிய அமௌண்டை இன்னொரு முறை கூறும்.

கஸ்டமர்: ஹா! இரண்டு நான்கு ஸைபர் ஸைபர் ஸைபர்... இருபத்து நான்காயிரம். 

கேஷியர்: இதனால் நீர் சொல்ல வந்தது?

கஸ்டமர்: இதுகூடத் தெரியவில்லையா தலைமை கேஷியருக்கு? இட் மீன்ஸ் ஐ நீட் ட்வென்டி போர் தௌசன்ட் ருப்பீஸ் (Rs.24000/=)...

கேஷியர்: ஆனால் உங்கள் அக்கௌண்டில் இருந்து நீங்கள் ஏற்கனேவே ATM  மூலம் Rs:2500 எடுத்திருப்பதால் தற்போது Rs:24000 தரவியலாது. இதுதான் எமது தீர்ப்பு. 

கஸ்டமர்: குழந்தையின் ஸ்கூலுக்கு பீஸ் கட்ட வேண்டும் என்று வருபவனுக்கும் இதே தீர்ப்புதானா?

கேஷியர்: ஆமாம் இதே தீர்ப்புதான். 

கஸ்டமர்: உங்கள் சொந்தக்காரர் நண்பர்களுக்கு இதே தீர்ப்புத்தானா?

கேஷியர்: ஆமாம்.

கஸ்டமர்: உங்கள் பிராஞ்ச் மேனேஜருக்கு?

கேஷியர்: அவரென்ன, எங்கள் சென்னை மண்டலத்தை நிர்வகிக்கும் ஜெனெரல் மேனஜருக்கும் இதே பதில்தான். 

கஸ்டமர்: மிஸ்டர் பரட்டை! நன்றாகப் பாரும்! இந்த ID கார்டை பாரும்! இப்போதும் அதே பதில்தானா?😳😳🙄

கேஷியர்: நீரே இந்த வங்கியின் புதிய சேர்மன் ஆகுக. IDயைக் காட்டினாலும் குற்றம் குற்றமே!

சிறந்த முதல்வரா
இல்லையா தெரியாது, 

அவர் கொண்டுவந்த திட்டங்கள் எல்லாம் மக்களுக்கு பலனளித்தனவா தெரியாது, 

எம்ஜிஆர் அளவுக்கு நற்காரியங்களை செய்திருக்கிறாரா தெரியாது,

 கலைஞரை விட அரசியல் ஞானம் கொண்டவரா தெரியாது,

 தமிழகத்தின்  மேல் உண்மையிலேயே பற்று கொண்டவரா தெரியாது, 
இது எதுவுமே 

தெரியாமல் போனாலும் 
ஒன்று மட்டும் நன்றாகத்தெரியும், இத்தனை ஆண் சிங்கங்கள் நடமாடும் அரசியல் காட்டுக்குள் ஒற்றை பெண்சிங்கமாய் உள்ளே நுழைந்து தனியொரு பெண்மணியாய் பல ஆண்டுகளாக ராஜ தர்பார் செய்தவர்! 

இவர்களை போன்ற ராஜதந்திரிகளுக்கு மத்தியில் வேறொரு பெண்ணால் இப்படி சாதிக்க முடியுமா என்றால் நிச்சயம் பெருத்த சந்தேகம் தான்! கணவனோடும் குடும்பத்தோடும் சிறு சிறு பிரச்சனைகள் என்றாலே உடைந்து போவதும், சிதைந்து போவதும், செத்துப்போவதுமாய் இருக்கின்ற பெண்களுக்கு மத்தியில் கடைசிவரை போர்க்களத்தில் நின்று,

வென்றாலும் வீழ்ந்தாலும் மீண்டும் எழுந்து நடந்து எல்லோரையும் அதிரவைத்த அந்த தைரியத்தை

 ஒவ்வொரு பெண்ணும் 

கற்றுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்! 
சம காலத்தில் வாழ்ந்த

 இதைவிட சிறந்த 

சாதனை பெண்மணி 
வேறு யாருமில்லை! 

அவர் வருவாரோ மாட்டாரோ தெரியாது, ஆனால் அவருடைய வாழ்க்கை நெருப்பின் ஊடே நிகழ்ந்த நெடும் வெற்றிப்பயணம்! அந்த நெருப்பு பயணத்தை நினைவில் வைத்துக்கொண்டாலே போதும்.....

 ஒவ்வொரு பெண்ணுக்கும் ஓராயிரம் கைதாங்கும் பலம் வந்து கஷ்டங்களை கடந்துவிடுவார்கள்! குறைகள் பல இருந்தாலும் பெருமைப்பட நிறைய விஷயங்கள் இருக்கிறது! 
கடவுள் அவர் பக்கம் நிற்கவே வேண்டுகிறேன்!

Nice line from Ratan Tata's Lecture- in London
👉1.
Don't educate
your children
to be rich.
Educate them
to be Happy.
So when
they grow up
they will know
the value of things
not the price

👉2.
"Eat your food
as your medicines.
Otherwise
you have to
eat medicines
as your food"

👉3.
The One
who loves you
will never leave you
because
even if there are
100 reasons
to give up
he will find
one reason
to hold on

👉4.
There is
a lot of difference
between
human being
and being human.
A Few understand it.

👉5.
You are loved
when you are born.
You will be loved
when you die.
In between
You have to manage...!

If u want to Walk Fast, 
Walk Alone..!
But 
if u want to Walk Far,
Walk Together..!!

15/12/16, 6:09 PM - Paiya perrippa: Someone asked,
"Why do we have Brakes in a car"

Many answers were provided like

 "to stop",

"to reduce speed",

 "to avoid collision" etc.

 But the *Best* I found was,

*"To allow you to drive faster"*

Give it a thought...
It's True, but seldom appreciated.

It's because we have brakes that we can dare to accelerate, dare to go fast and reach destinations we desire. 

At various points in life,
We found our parents, teachers, mentors, friends, colleagues and spouse etc. questioning our progress, direction or decision...
But remember, it's because of them that you are where you are today.

Learn to appreciate the *'Brakes'* in your life.

.      *நேர்மையான முதல்வர்* 
  
இந்தியாவில் முதலமைச்சர்கள், அமைச்சர்கள், எம்.எல்.ஏக்களைக் கூட விட்டு விடுவோம்....
ஒரு வார்டு கவுன்சிலர் ஒரு முறை பதவியில் இருந்தால் குத்து மதிப்பாக எத்தனை லட்சங்கள், எத்தனை கோடிகள் சம்பாதிப்பார் என்பதையே நம்மால் கணக்கிட முடியாது. *ஆனால் மூன்று முறை திரிபுரா மாநில முதலமைச்சராக இருந்த ஒருவரது மொத்த சொத்தின் மதிப்பு வெறும் 10,800 ரூபாய்தான் என்றால் நம்பமுடிகிறதா?!!!!?*

அவருக்குச் சொந்தமாக வீடோ, வாகனமோ, செல்போனோ கிடையாது என்றால்
நம்புவீர்களா?

வேறொரு நாட்டில் இருக்கும் யாரோ ஒருவரைப் பற்றிச் சொல்லும் இன்டர்நெட் செய்தி இல்லை இது.

நமது பாரத நாட்டின் வட உச்சியில் உட்கார்ந்திருக்கும் *திரிபுரா மாநிலத்தின்* முதலமைச்சர் *மாணிக் சர்க்கார்தான்* அந்த உத்தமர்.

தற்போது 64 வயதாகும் மாணிக்சர்க்கார் சி.பி.எம் கட்சியைச் சேர்ந்த முழு நேர ஊழியர். 1981 இடைத்தேர்தல் மூலம் எம்.எல்.ஏ ஆனவர். 1998ல் திரிபுராவின் முதல்வரானவர்.

மூன்று ஐந்தாண்டுகள் முதல்வராய் இருந்த அவர், சமீபத்தில் நடந்த சட்டமன்றத் தேர்தலிலும் வெற்றி பெற்று நான்காம் முறையாக முதல்வராகியுள்ளார்.
அதிலும் கடந்த தேர்தல்களைக் காட்டிலும் கூடுதல் சீட்டுகள் பெற்றும், அவரது தொகுதியில் கூடுதல் வாக்குகள் பெற்றும் முதல்வர் பதவியைத் தக்க வைத்திருக்கிறார். சமீபத்தில் நடந்த தேர்தலுக்கு வேட்பு மனு தாக்கல் செய்தபோது தனது சொத்துக் கணக்கை வெளியிட்டார்.

அவரின் மொத்த சொத்தின் மதிப்பே
ரூ.10,800-தான். மனைவி, பிள்ளைகள் பேரில் சொத்தை குவித்திருப்பாரோ என்று குறுக்கே சிந்திக்க வேண்டாம்.
அரசு ஊழியராய் இருந்து ஓய்வுபெற்ற *அவரது மனைவி பாஞ்சாலியின் மொத்த சேமிப்பு ரூ 46,000-தான்*

*இந்தத் தம்பதிக்குக் குழந்தைகள் இல்லை*. சொந்த வீடோ, வாகனமோ கிடையாது. சொந்த வேலையாக வெளியே போனால், ஆட்டோ ரிக்ஷா பயணம்தான்.

*சர்க்காரின் அரசு காரில், சுழலும் சிவப்பு விளக்கும் கிடையாது*. *முதலமைச்சருக்கு என்று ஒரு சம்பளம் உண்டல்லவா?*
*_அதையும் கட்சிக்குக் கொடுத்து விடுகிறார் சர்க்கார்_*. *கட்சி பார்த்து அவருக்கு மாதச் சம்பளம் ரூ 5000 தருகிறது*.
*'இந்த பணமும் எனது மனைவியின் பென்சனும் எங்கள் எளிய வாழ்க்கைக்குப் போதுமானது'* என்கிறார் மாணிக் சர்க்கார்.

‘தினமும் காலை, அவர் உடுத்தும் உடைகளை அவரே துவைத்து போட்டு விட்டுத்தான் வெளியே கிளம்புவார்’ என்று தனது கணவர் பற்றி கூறுகிறார் பாஞ்சாலி...
‘எனது வெட்டிச் செலவு என்று பார்த்தால் தினசரி ஒரு சிறிய மூக்குப் பொடி மட்டை, 
ஒரு சிகரெட்தான்’ என்று முன்பு ஒருமுறை வெள்ளந்தியாய் கூறிய சர்க்கார்:
தற்போது அந்தப் பழக்கங்களையும் விட்டுவிட்டார்.

2009ல் சர்க்காரின் அம்மா மறைந்த போது, பூர்வீக வீடு ஒன்று அவருக்கு வந்து சேர்ந்தது. வாரிசு இல்லாத தனக்கு அந்த வீடு தேவையில்லை என்று கூறி, தனது தங்கைக்கு அந்த வீட்டைக் கொடுத்து விட்டார் சர்க்கார். சர்க்காரின் அப்பா ஒரு சாதாரண டெய்லர். ஆனாலும் 60களின் இறுதியிலேயே சர்க்காரை மேற்குவங்காள பல்கலைக்கழகத்தில் பட்டப்படிப்பு படிக்க வைத்தார் அவர்.

சர்க்காரின் குடும்பத்தினர், உறவினர்கள் எல்லோருமே சராசரி நடுத்தர வர்க்கத்துக்கும் கொஞ்சம் கீழே உள்ள குடும்பங்கள்தான்.

நண்பர்களே....... 
இவர் உத்தமர்.....!!!!

பொறாமை கொள்ளுங்கள் நண்பர்களே...........

நீங்கள் உண்மையான இந்தியன் என்றால் அனைவருக்கும் பகிரவும்.

கிரேக்க பேரரசர் ஜூலியஸ் சீசர் மரணப் படுக்கையில் இருக்க , அவரின் உடல்நலம் பற்றி வெளியே தெரிந்தால் அண்டை நாட்டு மன்னன் கிரேக்கத்தை கைப்பற்ற முயலக் கூடும் என்பதால் ரகசியமாக அரண்மனையில் வைத்தியம் நடக்கிறது.
அரசர் நலம் பெற்று விரைவில் மக்கள் முன் தரிசனம் தருவார் என அறிவிக்கிறார் பேரரசி கிளியோபாட்ரா .
இருந்தாலும் மக்கள் மத்தியில் கவலை . மருத்துவக் கடவுளை நோக்கி ஓடுகிறார்கள்.
ஒலிம்பஸ் குன்றின் அடிவாரத்தில் மக்கள் குவிகிறார்கள் . இருந்தாலும் குன்றின் மேல் ஏற மக்களுக்கு அனுமதியில்லை. கீழே இருந்தவாறே சூரியனை தொழுகிறார்கள். ஏனென்றால் சூரியனுக்கான கிரேக்க கடவுள் தான் மருத்துவத்திற்கும் கடவுள் .
மந்திரி பிரதானிகளுடன் தலைமை மருத்துவ குரு குன்றின் மேலே, மருத்துவ கடவுளை நோக்கி பூஜை செய்தார். திடீரென அவர் கண்களில் பிரகாசம் ...
மந்திரிகள் என்ன என்று கேட்க ...
மருத்துவ கடவுள் தன் கண் முன் தோன்றியதாகவும் மன்னர் குணமாவார் என கூறியதாகவும் சொன்னார்.
எங்கள் கண்களுக்கு கடவுள் தெரியவில்லையே என மந்திரிகள் கேட்க , யாருடைய மனைவி பத்தினியோ அவர்கள் கண்ணுக்கு மட்டுமே கடவுள் தெரிவார் என கூறிவிட்டு குரு புறப்பட்டார்.
நம் கண்களுக்கு தெரியவில்லை என கூறினால் நம் மனைவி பத்தினி இல்லை என ஆகிவிடும் .எனவே நேரம் ஆக ஆக எல்லா மந்திரிகளும் கடவுளை பார்த்துவிட்டதாக கூறி கீழே வந்தனர். மக்களிடம் மருத்துவக் கடவுளை கண்டதாகவும் ,மன்னர் குணமாகிவிடுவார் என கூறியதாகவும் தெரிவித்தனர்.
இருந்தாலும் மக்களிடம் குழப்பம் நீடிக்கவே , தலைமை தளபதி வந்து மலையில் ஏறி , அவரும் கடவுளை பார்த்ததாக கூறினார்.
இது தான் சாக்கு என மன்னனால் ஓரம்கட்டப்பட்டு இருந்த குறுநில மன்னன் தாலாமாவல்ஸ் ஒலிம்பஸ் மலைக்கு வந்தார். மலையின் இரண்டாம் சுற்று வரை சென்றதாகவும் , கடவுளை பார்த்தவர்கள் மன்னர் குணமாகி விடுவார் என கூறியதாகவும் சொன்னார்.
மன்னர் குணமானாரா? இல்லையா? என்ற மர்மம் நீடித்தது.
இதில் கவனிக்கப்பட வேண்டியது என்ன என்றால் ..
கிரேக்க புராணங்களின் படி .. மருத்துவ கடவுளின் பெயர் என்ன தெரியுமா... ?
"அப்போலோ"

04/01/17, 9:57 AM - Paiya perrippa: According to folklore in Haryana – When Lord Krishna returned home after the battle of Mahabharata, his wife Rukmani confronted him “How could you be party to the killing of Guru Drona and Bheeshma, who were such righteous people and had a lifetime of righteousness behind them.”
Initially Lord Krishna avoided her questions but when she did not relent, he replied “No doubt they had a lifetime of rightousness behind them but they both had committed one single sin that destroyed all their lifetime of righteousness”
Rukmani asked “And what was that sin?”
Lord Krishna replied “They were both present in the court when a lady (Draupadi) was being disrobed and being elders they had the authority to stop it but they did not. This single crime is enough to destroy all righteousness of this world”
Rukmani asked “But what about Karna? He was known for his charity. No one went emptyhanded from his doorstep. Why did you have him killed?”
Lord Krishna said “No doubt Karna was known for his charity. He never said ‘No’ to anyone who asked him for anything. But when Abhimanyu fell after successfully fighting an army of the greatest warriors and he lay dying, he asked for water from Karna who stood nearby. There was a puddle of clean water where Karna stood but not wanting to annoy his friend Duryodhan, Karna did not give water to a dying man. In doing so his charity of a lifetime was destroyed. Later in battle, it was the same puddle of water in which the wheel of his chariot got stuck and he was killed.”
Understand that your one act of injustice can destroy your whole life of honesty.

10/01/17, 7:51 AM - Pornima Akka: Coffee on wall :---

" Very nice story to read....

I sat with my friend in a well-known coffee shop in a neighbouring town of Venice (Italy), the city of lights and water.

As we enjoyed our coffee, a man entered and sat at an empty table beside us.

He called the waiter and placed his order saying,

‘Two cups of coffee, one of them there on the wall.’

We heard this order with rather interest and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two.

As soon as he left, the waiter pasted a piece of paper on the wall saying 
‘A Cup of Coffee’.

While we were still there, two other men entered and ordered three cups of coffee, two on the table and one on the wall.

They had the two cups of coffee but paid for three and left.

This time also, the waiter did the same;

he pasted a piece of paper on the wall saying, ‘A Cup of Coffee’.

It was something unique and perplexing for us.

We finished our coffee, paid the bill and left.

After a few days, we had a chance to go to this coffee shop again.

While we were enjoying our coffee, a man poorly dressed entered.

As he seated himself, he looked at the wall and said, 'One cup of coffee from the wall'.

The waiter served coffee to this man with the customary respect and dignity.

The man had his coffee and left without paying.

We were amazed to watch all this, as the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dust bin.

Now it was no surprise for us – the matter was very clear.

The great respect for the needy shown by the inhabitants of this town made our eyes well up in tears.

Ponder upon the need of what this man wanted...

He enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self-esteem…

he has no need to ask for a free cup of coffee…

without asking or knowing about the one who is giving this cup of coffee to him.

He only looked at the wall, placed an order for himself, enjoyed his coffee and left.

... probably the most beautiful wall you may ever see anywhere....!!!

Worth sharing......

It is what makes us human.....😊

17/01/17, 6:21 AM - Paiya perrippa: ஒரு யுத்தத்தில் எதிரி நாட்டு இளவரசனை உயிரோடு பிடித்து இராஜாவின் முன்பு நிறுத்தினர். 

இளவரசன் தன் உயிருக்காகக் கெஞ்சி மன்றாடி தன்னை மன்னிக்கும்படியாக கேட்டுக்கொண்டான். 

அதற்க்கு ஒரு நிபந்தனை இருக்கிறது என்றார் வெற்றி பெற்ற ராஜா .

விளிம்புவரை தண்ணீர் நிரப்பப்பட்ட பாத்திரம் ஒன்று உனது கையில் தரப்படும்." 

அது முக்கிய சாலை ஒன்றின் வழியாக ஒரு சொட்டு தண்ணீர் கூட கீழே சிந்தாமல் குறிப்பிட்ட நேரத்துக்குள் ஒரு மையில் தூரம் கொண்டு செல்ல வேண்டும். 

கூடவே உருவிய பட்டையத்தோடுஎனது வீரர்கள் வந்துக்கொண்டு இருப்பார்கள். 

ஒருதுளி தண்ணீர் கீழே கொட்டினாலும் கூட அவர்களின் வாள் உன் தலையைச் சீவிவிடும். 

வெற்றியோடு முடித்துவிட்டால் விடுதலை" 

என்று பேரரசர் தனது நிபந்தனையை விதித்தார்.

குறிப்பிட்ட நேரம் வந்தது. 

இலட்சக்கணக்கான மக்கள் அந்த சாலையின் இரு பகுதிகளிலும் குழுமியிருந்தனர்.  

போர் வீரர்கள்  சாலையைஒழுங்கு செய்து கொடுத்தனர். 

பேரரசர்  முன்னிலையில் முழுவதும் தண்ணீர் நிரப்பிய பாத்திரம் இளவரசனின்  கைகளில் கொடுக்கப்பட்டது. 

 ஒரு பகுதியில் இருந்த மக்கள் இளவரசனை ஊக்குவித்து  உற்ச்சாகப் படுத்தினர். 

மறுபக்கத்தில் இருந்தவர்களோ கேலியும் பரிகாசமும் செய்து கூச்சலிட்டனர். 

இளவரசனின் இருபுறமும் வீரர்கள் உருவிய வாளோடு தண்ணீர் சிந்துமானால் வெட்டும்படி கவனித்துக்கொண்டிருந்தனர்.  

பாத்திரத்தை உறுதியாய் பிடித்துக்கொண்டான் இளவரசன் நடக்க  சுற்றுப்புறத்திலிருந்து *கூச்சலும், பரிகாசமும்,* ஆர்ப்பாட்டங்களும் கேட்டுக்கொண்டே இருந்தது.  

எனினும் எதையும் பொருட்படுத்தாதபடி தண்ணீரிலே முழு கவனமும் வைத்து ஓட்டத்தை  *வெற்றியோடு* ஓடி🏃 முடித்தான் இளவரசன் .

இளவரசனை பாராட்டிய பேரரசர் 

இளவரசனே உன்னை கேலி செய்தவர்களுக்கு நீ தண்டனை வழங்கலாம்.  

உன்னை உற்ச்சாக படுத்தியவர்களுக்கு நன்றி சொல்லலாம். 

அவர்களை கவனித்து வைத்திருக்கிறாயா என்று கேட்டார்.?

என்னை போற்றுபவர்களை நான் கவனிக்கவில்லை,

தூற்றுபவர்களையும் நான் பார்க்கவில்லை. 

"எனது கவனமெல்லாம் தண்ணீரில்  அல்லவா இருந்தது." 

விடுதலையோடு  கூட அரசர் ஒரு ஆலோசனை தந்தார். 

இளவரசனே

*பாத்திரத்தில் உள்ள தண்ணீர் தான் உன் சரீரத்தில் உள்ள *ஆன்மா*

*வாழும்  நாட்களிலே  உன் ஆத்மாவில் கண்ணும்  கருத்துமாக இருந்து கடைசியில்  அதை *சிருஷ்டிகர்த்தாவிடம்* 
*ஒப்படைக்க வேண்டும்*. 

🏼போற்றுவோரைக் கண்டுபெருமை கொள்ளாதே.*

🏼தூற்றுவோரைக்கண்டு சோர்ந்துப் போகாதே. ஆத்துமாவில் *கவனம் வை* என்றார்.படித்ததில் பிடித்தது அறுமையான கதையும் கருத்தும்.நன்றி

சமூக வலைதள நண்பர்களே நடிகர் நடிகைகளின் பிறந்த நாளுக்கு ட்விட்டரில் ட்ரெண்ட் செய்யும் நாம் நம் கலாச்சாரத்தை காக்க ஒரு சிறு உதவி... முகநூலில் PETA India என தேடவும்... அந்த பக்கத்திற்குள் சென்று ரிப்போர்ட் செய்யவும் 1000+ ரிப்போர்ட் சென்றால் முகநூலில் இருந்து அந்த பக்கம் முடக்கப்படும்... 

இதன் மூலம் என்ன கிடைக்கிறது என்று யோசிக்காதிர்கள்.  இதுவும் ஒரு வகையில் நம் எதிர்பை.... அந்த நபர்கள் புரிந்து கொள்வார்கள்.

சரி ரிப்போர்ட் செய்வது எப்படி ????

step1: PETA India என முகநூலில் தேடவும் 
 step2: More என்ற பட்டனை க்ளிக் செய்யவும் 
step 3: ரிப்போர்ட் என்ற பட்டனை க்ளிக் செய்யவும் 
Step4: It's Scam என்ற பட்டனை க்ளிக் செய்து Continue கொடுக்கவும்...
 Step5: உங்களுடைய ரிப்போர்ட் பதிவாகிவிடும்...

 தமிழா நம் கலாசாரத்திற்காக இரண்டு நிமிடம் செலவிடு....இதை எல்லா குழுவிற்கும் பகிறவும்

21/01/17, 1:16 PM - Vidya Perima: உருகி உருகி நான் பிராத்திக்கும் கடவுளிடம் ஒரு நாள் பேச சந்தர்ப்பம் கிடைத்தது.

நான் : கடவுளே நான் உங்க கிட்டே ஒரு விளக்கம் கேட்கலாமா?

கடவுள் : தாரளமாக கேள்

நான் : பொறுமையா கோபப்படாமல் பதில் சொல்வீர்களா?

கடவுள் : சத்தியமாக!

நான் : இன்னைக்கு ஏன் எனக்கு இப்படி ஒரு மோசமான நாளை கொடுத்தீங்க?

கடவுள் : என்னப்பா சொல்லுற நீ?

நான் : எப்பவும் சரியா எழுந்திருக்கிற நான் இன்னைக்கு எழுந்திரிச்சதே லேட்

கடவுள் : ஆமாம்! அவசரத்துல என்னை கூட கும்பிடாம ஆபீஸ்க்கு புறப்பட்டாய்.

நான் : கிளம்பினதே லேட் இதுல என் பைக் வேற பஞ்சர் ஆகியிருந்தது.

கடவுள் : ஆமாம் எனக்கு தெரியும்.

நான் : சரி! பஸ்ல போலாம்னு பஸ்ஸை பிடிச்சா வழியில ஏதோ ஆக்சிடெண்ட் போல ஒரே டிராஃபிக் ஜாம். ஆபீஸ்க்கு ஒரு மணிநேரம் லேட்.

கடவுள் : ஆமாம்! தெரியும்.

நான் : மதியம் சாப்பிட கொஞ்சம் லேட் ஆகிடிச்சு அதுக்குள்ளே கேண்டீன்ல சாப்பாடு காலியாயிடுச்சு கடைசீயில பசிக்கு ஏதோ கிடைச்சதை அரைகுறையா சாப்பிட்டுட்டு வந்தேன்.

கடவுள் : ஆமாம் அதுவும் தெரியும்.

நான் : வங்கியில் பர்சனல் லோன் அப்ளை பண்ணியிருந்தேன். அது விஷயமா ஒருத்தர் கிட்டே ஃபோனை எதிர்பார்த்திருந்தேன். சாயந்திரம் வீட்டுக்கு திரும்பும்போது அவர் கிட்டேயிருந்து எனக்கு கால் வந்தது. பேட்டரியில சார்ஜ் இல்லாம மொபைல் அந்த நேரம் பார்த்து ஆஃப் ஆயிடிச்சு.

கடவுள் : ஆமாம் தெரியும்.

நான் : அதை பிடிச்சி! இதை பிடிச்சி! முட்டி மோதி வீட்டுக்கு வந்து கொஞ்ச நேரம் ரூம்ல ஏ.சி.யில உட்கார்ந்து டி.வி.யை பார்த்து ரிலாக்ஸ் பண்ணலாம்னா ஏ.சி. ரிப்பேர் ஆகி வேலை செய்யல

இன்னைக்கு எனக்கு எதுவுமே சரியில்லையே ஒரு நாள் உங்களை கும்பிட மறந்ததுக்கு இவ்ளோ கஷ்டங்களா?

(கடவுள் பலமாக சிரிக்கிறார். சில வினாடிகள் கழித்து! பேச ஆரம்பிக்கிறார்)

கடவுள் : இன்னைக்கு உன் கர்மாவின் படி மிகவும் மோசமான நாள். நீ காலை அசந்து தூங்கிகிட்டிருக்கும்போதே மரணதேவன் உன்னை நோக்கி வந்துட்டான். அவன் கூட வாக்குவாதம் பண்ணி உன்னை காப்பாற்ற வேண்டி உன்னை கொஞ்சம் அதிக நேரம் தூங்க வெச்சேன்.

நான் : (அதிர்ச்சியுடன்) ஓ

கடவுள் : உன் பைக்கை பஞ்சராக்கினேன். ஏன்னா! நீ ஆபீஸ் போகும்போது நீ போற ரூட்ல பிரேக் பிடிக்காம தாறுமாறா ஓடுற வேன் ஒன்னு உன் மேல இடிக்கிறதா இருந்தது. அந்த வேன் ஆக்சிடெண்ட்டாகி தான் டிராபிக் ஆச்சு. நீ பைக்ல போயிருந்தா அந்த வேன் மரணதேவன் கணக்குப்படி உன் மேல இடிச்சிருக்கும்.

நான் : (அடக்கத்துடன்) ஓ

கடவுள் : மதியம் உனக்கு சாப்பாடு கிடைக்காம போனதுக்கு காரணம் கடைசீயா மிச்சமிருந்த குழம்புல எலிக்கு வெச்சிருந்த எலி பாஷாணம் எப்படியோ தவறி விழுந்துடிச்சு! யாரும் அதை கவனிக்கல அதை நீ சாப்பிட்டிருந்தா என்னாகியிருக்கும்?

நான் : (கண்கலங்கியபடி) ம்ம்

கடவுள் : சாயந்திரம் உன் அலைபேசி சுவிச் ஆப் ஆனதுக்கு காரணம்! அந்த நபர் உனக்கு தவறான வாக்குறுதிகள் கொடுத்து இக்கட்டில் மாட்டிவிட இருந்தார். எனவே அதிலிருந்து காப்பாற்ற வேண்டி உன் ஃபோனை செயலிழக்கச் செய்துவிட்டேன்.

நான் : ம்ம்

கடவுள் : அப்புறம் அந்த ஏ.சி. மெஷின் எர்த் கோளாறு ஏற்பட்டு அதில் முறையற்ற முறையில் கரண்ட் வந்துகொண்டிருந்தது. ஒருவேளை முகம் கழுவிக்கொண்டு ஈர கைகளுடன் எப்போதும் போல நீ சுவிச்சை தொட்டிருந்தால் அந்த கணமே தூக்கி எறியப்பட்டிருப்பாய், ஆகையால் அதை செயலிழக்கச் செய்தேன்.

என்னை வணங்க மறந்ததால் அன்று முழுதும் நீ சோதனையை சந்தித்தாய் என்று என்னை தவறாக நினைத்துகொண்டாய். ஆனால் அனுதினமும் நீ என்னை வணங்கி வந்த காரணத்தால் நீ என்னை மறந்த அன்றும் கூட நான் உன்னை காக்க மறக்கவில்லை.

நான் : இப்போ புரிகிறது இறைவா! என் மீது நீங்கள் கொண்டுள்ள அன்பும் அக்கறையும். இது புரியாமல் உங்களை ரொம்பவும் நிந்தித்துவிட்டேன். என்னை மன்னித்துவிடுங்கள்.

கடவுள் : மன்னிப்பு கேட்காதே! என்னை நம்பு, எப்போதும் எந்த சூழ்நிலையிலும். அது போதும்!

நான் : நிச்சயமாக

கடவுள் : நீ திட்டமிடுவதை விட உனக்காக நான் திட்டமிடுவது எப்போதும் சரியாகவே இருக்கும்.

நான் : இனி நிச்சயம் உங்களை சந்தேகப்படமாட்டேன். உங்கள் அருளை சந்தேகப்படமட்டேன். கண்ணை இமை காப்பது போல ஒவ்வொரு கணமும் நீங்கள் என்னை காப்பதை புரிந்துகொண்டேன்.

கடவுள் : என்னை நம்பியிருப்பவர்களை நான் என்றும் கைவிடுவதில்லை!

And look at this symmetry :
1 x 1 = 1
11 x 11 = 121
111 x 111 = 12321
1111 x 1111 = 1234321

11111111 x 11111111 = 123456787654321
111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321

31/01/17, 9:57 AM - Paiya perrippa: Every year, at the Australian Open, behind Rodger Federer's coach (earlier Edberg and now Ljubicic), sits an elderly couple.
 
There is a story to this couple, and it shows what a good human being Federer is. The couple are Bob and Diana Carter, the parents of his first international coach, the Australian Peter Carter.
 
Federer was just nine when Carter took him under his wing.
 
In 2002, in a terrible tragedy, Carter died in a car accident while on a vacation with his wife.  He was only 37 years of age. The story goes that Federer (then 21) was so affected by his coach's death, he ran through the streets of Toronto (where he was playing that day), bawling his heart out.
 
Carter had recognised Federer's genius at a young age, and was determined to make him an all-time great. He was not Federer's first coach, but the one who took him from relative obscurity in Basel in Switzerland to the threshold of international greatness.
 
Every year since 2005, Federer's team sends an all-expenses paid itinerary to the Adelaide-based couple - first-class air tickets, bookings in the same hotel as Federer, food, winner's parties and even commiseration parties in Melbourne.
 
And they sit in Federer's box at the Rod Laver Arena, supporting him as if he were their son. They see their son Peter in him. And Federer never forgets the Carter family's role in his life and career.
 
Federer, now 36, has just won his 18th Grand Slam  is one of the greatest humans to have set foot on a tennis court.
Remember the people and the things that have made an impact in your life
31/01/17, 5:40 PM - Paiya perrippa: Never Joke with an Engineer :* Engineers Can Prove Anything For 10 Marks

Question : Prove : PAPA = MAMA 

Medical Doctor :” Out Of Course”

Accountant: ”No Way”

Barrister: ”Cannot Be Proved”

Social sciences: Not in this world, 

but…..

Engineer: Its Simple Solution

As we know,

Pressure(P)= Force/Area

i.e P = F/A

∴F = PA ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ (i)

Now ,aacording to Newtons 2nd law of Motion,

Force(F) = Mass(M) × Acceleration(A)

i.e F =MA ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅(ii)

From equation (i) and (ii)

PA = MA

Squaring both sides

(PA)² = (MA)²

∴ PAPA = MAMA

03/02/17, 9:10 AM - Paiya perrippa: படிக்கவேண்டிய கதை! பகிர்கிறேன்!

புறம் பேசாதீர்

காட்டுப்பகுதியில் ஆழ்ந்த தவத்தில் இருந்தார் அந்த மகரிஷி. அவர் தவத்தின் போதே கண் திறக்காமல், தினமும் ஒருமுறை கையை நீட்டுவார். கையில் யாராவது எதையாவது வைத்தால், அது என்ன ஏதென்று பார்க்காமல் அப்படியே விழுங்கி விடுவார். முனிவர் கையை நீட்டும் நேரம் பார்த்து, பக்தர்கள் நறுக்கிய கனிகள், அப்பம் முதலியவற்றை வைப்பார்கள். இதனால் தங்களுக்கு புண்ணியம் சேரும் என்று அவர்கள் கருதினர்.

ஒருநாள் அந்த நாட்டின் அரசன் வேட்டைக்கு வந்தான். அன்று பக்தர்கள் யாரும் வரவில்லை. அந்நேரம் பார்த்து, மகரிஷி கையை நீட்டினார். மன்னன் மகரிஷியைப் பரிகாசம் செய்யும் நோக்கத்தில், தான் வந்த குதிரை போட்ட சாணத்தில் சிறிது எடுத்து மகரிஷியின் கையில் வைத்தான். மகரிஷியும் அதை வாயில் போட்டு விட்டார். மன்னன் கலகலவென சிரித்தபடியே அங்கிருந்து போய்விட்டான்.

மறுநாள் மன்னனின் நலம் விரும்பியாக உள்ள வேறு ஒரு முனிவர் அரசவைக்கு வந்தார். முக்காலமும் உணர்ந்த அவர், ‘மன்னா! நேற்று நீ காட்டில் தவமிருக்கும் மகரிஷிக்கு, குதிரைச்சாணம் கொடுத்தாய் அல்லவா?. அது நரகத்தில் மலை போல் வளர்ந்து கொண்டிருக்கிறது. நீ நரகம் வந்ததும், அதை உண்ண வைப்பார்கள். அதற்கு தயாராக இரு!’ என்று கூறி விட்டு போய்விட்டார். 

மன்னன் நடுங்கி விட்டான். தான் விளையாட்டாக செய்த தவறை எண்ணி வருந்தினான்.
தான தர்மங்கள் செய்து, தன் பாவங்களைக் குறைக்க முடிவெடுத்தான். அரண்மனை நந்தவனத்தில் ஒரு குடில் அமைத்து அங்கேயே தங்கினான். அரண்மனை ஆடம்பர சுகத்தை மறந்தான். தன் நாட்டிலுள்ள இளம்பெண்களை குடிலுக்கு வரவழைத்து, அவர்களது திருமணத்துக்கு தேவையான நகை, பணம் கொடுத்து, பாவம் செய்வதின் கெடுதல் பற்றி எடுத்துக்கூறி அனுப்பிவைத்தான். இது நாள்தோறும் நடைபெறும் ஒரு நிகழ்வாக மாறிவிட்டது.

அரசனின் இந்த தினசரி வழக்கத்தை, அந்த நாட்டில் சிலர் வேறுமாதிரியாக கதை கட்டி விட்டனர். ‘மன்னன், இளம்பெண்களை தவறான நோக்கில் குடிலுக்கு வரச் சொல்கிறான். தவறுக்கு கூலியாக நகை, பணம் தருகிறான்’ என்று திரித்துக் கூறினர். இப்படியாக பல விமர்சனங்கள் வந்தவண்ணமிருந்தன.

ஒருநாள் கற்புக்கரசியான பெண் ஒருத்தி, பார்வையற்ற தன் கணவருடன், அரசனின் குடில் முன்பாக நின்று யாசகம் கேட்டாள். அந்த கணவன், ‘நீ யார் வீட்டு முன்பு இப்போது நிற்கிறாய்?’ எனக் கேட்டான்.
‘அரசன் அமைத்திருக்கும் குடில் முன்பு’ என்று பதிலளித்தாள் அந்தப் பெண்.
அதற்கு அவளது கணவன், ‘ஓ! தானம் கொடுப்ப தாகச் சொல்லிக் கொண்டு, பெண்களின் கற்பைச் சூறையாடுகிறானே, அவன் வீட்டு முன்பா?’ என்றான். அந்தப் பெண் பதறிப்போய் உடனடியாக அவனது வாயைப் பொத்தினாள்.

பின் மெதுவாக தன் கணவனிடம் கூறத்தொடங்கினாள். ‘சுவாமி! என் கற்பின் சக்தியால், நான் முக்காலத்தையும் உணர்ந்து சொல்வேன் என்பதை நீங்கள் அறிவீர்கள். இந்த மன்னன், ஒரு மகரிஷிக்கு குதிரைச் சாணத்தை கொடுத்தான். அது நரகத்தில் மலையளவாக குவிந்து, இவன் உண்பதற்காக தயாரானது. அவ்விஷயம் மன்னனுக்குத் தெரிய வரவே, அந்த பாவ மலையை கரைக்கும் பொருட்டு, கன்னியருக்கு தானதர்மம் செய்து நற்போதனைகளைச் செய்து வருகிறான்.

ஆனால் சிலர் மன்னனைப் பற்றி தவறாகப் பேசி, அவனுக்காக குவிக்கப்பட்டிருந்த சாண மலையில், ஒவ்வொரு கவளமாக ஒவ்வொருவரும் பங்கிட்டுக் கொண்டனர். கடைசி கவளம் மட்டும் பாக்கியிருந்தது. தற்போது மன்னனைப் பற்றி தவறாகப் பேசியதன் காரணமாக, அந்த கடைசி கவளத்தை தாங்கள் எடுத்துக் கொண்டீர்கள். மேலும் அடுத்தப் பிறவியிலும் கூட தாங்கள் பார்வையற்றவராகவே பிறப்பீர்கள்’ என்று கூறினாள். அதிர்ச்சியில் அப்படியே உறைந்து போனான் அவளது கணவன்.

தவறு செய்தவர்கள் திருந்த எடுக்கும் முயற்சியை விமர்சிக்கக் கூடாது. அவர்களை தவறாக விமர்சித்தால், அவர் செய்த பாவங்களைப் பங்கு போட்டுக் கொள்ளும் நிலைமைக்கு ஆளாக வேண்டி வரும்.

 உண்மை என்னவென்று அறிந்து கொள்ளாமல், காலத்துக்கும் வம்பு பேசிக்கொண்டு மற்றவர்களின் பாவத்தை சிலர் பங்கிட்டுக்கொள்கிறார்கள். அந்த தவறை நாம் ஒரு போதும் செய்யக்கூடாது.

நாம் செய்த பாவத்தை சுமக்கவே, நமக்கு இந்த ஒரு பிறவி போதுமா என்பது தெரியாத நிலையில், தேவையில்லாமல் புறம்பேசி அடுத்தவரின் பாவத்தையும் சேர்த்து சுமக்க வேண்டுமா என்ன!
03/02/17, 9:56 AM - Pornima Akka: Once a Chinese man came to Goa for holidays. 

At Airport he hired a taxi to take him to Panjim. 

On the way he sees a bus 🚌. He said - "The buses here are so slow and nois .. In China the buses are very fast." 

At Cortalim Bridge Chinese sees a train passing by on the railway bridge the other side...... he says - "The trains here are so slow..... in China the trains are very fast." 

All the way driver kept silent and drove to Panjim. 

Chinese man 👨 gets off the taxi and asked for meter readings. 

Driver - "₹ 5000." 

Chinese -" ₹ 5000 ? Are you kidding ? Your buses are so slow, the trains are so slow...  if everything else here is so slow then how come the meter of your taxi is so fast ? "

Driver -" Because the meter is made in China. "

05/02/17, 11:47 AM - Paiya perrippa: பெரியவா சரணம்

"மிகவும் பழைய காலத்து வாய்ஸ் ரிகார்டர் எதுவென்று யாருக்காவது தெரியுமா?"-பெரியவா கேள்வி

"விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமம் நமக்கு எப்படி கிடைத்தது?"

சொன்னவர்-பட்டு ஸாஸ்திரிகள்
நன்றி-பால ஹனுமான்.

1950-களில் ஒருநாள் ஒரு வானொலி நிருபர் ஸ்ரீமஹாபெரியவாளை பேட்டிகண்டு அதனை டேப்ரிகார்டரில் பதிவு செய்துகொண்டிருந்தார். திடீரென்று பெரியவா அவரிடமும்,அங்கு இருந்தவர்களிடமும்,"மிகவும் பழைய காலத்து வாய்ஸ் ரிகார்டர் எதுவென்று யாருக்காவது தெரியுமா?" என்று கேட்டார். யாரும் பதில் சொல்லவில்லை.

பெரியவா மற்றொரு கேள்வியைக் கேட்டார்,"விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமம் நமக்கு எப்படி கிடைத்தது?"

...
யாரோ ஒருவர்,"விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை பீஷ்மர் நமக்குத் தந்தார்" என்றார். அனைவரும் "ஆம்" என்று ஒப்புக்கொண்டனர். பெரியவா சிரித்துக்கொண்டே தலையசைத்துவிட்டு, மற்றொரு கேள்வியை வீசினார்,"குருக்ஷேத்திரத்தில் அனைவரும் பீஷ்மர் சொன்ன விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை பக்தியோடு கேட்டுக் கொண்டிருந்தபோது, அதனை குறிப்பெடுத்ததோ, எழுதிக்கொண்டதோ யார்?" மீண்டும் அமைதி.

ஸ்ரீசரணர் புன்னகையுடன் சொல்ல ஆரம்பித்தார்.........

“பீஷ்மர், ஸ்ரீகிருஷணரின் புகழையும், பெருமைகளையும் விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தால் விளக்கிக் கொண்டிருந்தபோது, ஸ்ரீகிருஷணரும், வியாசரும் உட்பட அனைவரும் வேறு எந்த நினைப்புமின்றி அவரையே உன்னிப்பாக கவனித்துக்கொண்டிருந்தனர். பிதாமகர் பீஷ்மர் ஆயிரம் நாமங்களையும் சொல்லி முடித்தபின்பு அனைவரும் விழிப்படைந்தனர்.

முதலில் யுதிஷ்ட்டிரர் பேசினார்,"பிதாமகர், ஸ்ரீவாசுதேவரின் ஒப்பற்ற பெருமை வாய்ந்த ஆயிரம் புனித நாமாக்களை சொன்னார். அவற்றைக் கேட்பதில் கவனமாக இருந்த நாம் அனைவரும் அவற்றை குறிப்பெடுக்கவோ, எழுதிக்கொள்ளவோ தவறிவிட்டோம். நாம் அற்புதமான விஷயத்தை இழந்து நிற்கின்றோம்" என்றார். அப்போதுதான் அனைவரும் எப்படிப்பட்ட தவறு நேர்ந்துவிட்டதென்று உணர்ந்து திகைத்தனர்.

பிறகு யுதிஷ்டிரர் ஸ்ரீகிருஷணரிடம் திரும்பி,"ஆயிரம் புனித நாமாக்களை மீட்டுத்தர தாங்களாவது உதவக்கூடாதா" என்று கேட்டார். ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணர் வழக்கம்போல், "என்னால் மட்டும் என்ன செய்ய முடியும்? உங்கள் எல்லோரையும் போல நானும் ஆச்சார்யர் பீஷ்மரைத்தான் பார்த்துக்கொண்டிருந்தேன் என்றார்.

அனைவரும் சேர்ந்து ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணரிடம், "ஹே.. வாசுதேவா, நீ ஆனைத்தும் அறிந்தவர். உம்மால் இயலாததென்பது எதுவுமே இல்லை. தாங்கள் தயைகூர்ந்து எங்களுக்கு உதவ வேண்டும். அந்த ஒப்புயர்வற்ற பெருமைவாய்ந்த பரந்தாமனின் ஆயிரம் புனித நாமாக்களை மீட்டுத்தர வேணடும். அது தங்களால் மட்டுமே முடியும்" என்று வேண்டினர்.

அதற்கு ஸ்ரீகிருஷ்ணர்,"இதனை செய்ய முடிந்த ஒருவர் உங்களுக்குள்ளேயே இருக்கின்றார்" என்றார். எவருக்கும் ஒன்றும் புரியவில்லை. ஸ்ரீவாசுதேவர் தொடர்ந்தார்,"சகாதேவன் அதனை மீட்டு சொல்ல, வியாசர் எழுதுவார்" என்றார். அனைவரும் சகாதேவனால் எப்படி சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை மீட்க முடியும் என்பதை அறிய ஆவலாக இருந்தனர். ஸ்ரீவாசுதேவர் கூறினார்,"உங்கள் அனைவருள்ளும் சகாதேவன் மட்டுமே 'சுத்த ஸ்படிக' மாலை அணிந்திருந்தான். சகாதேவன் சிவபெருமானை பிரார்த்தனை செய்து தியானித்து 'சுத்த ஸ்படிகம்' உள்வாங்கியுள்ள சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை சப்த அலைகளாக மாற்ற, அதனை வியாசர் எழுதிக்கொள்ளுவார்" என்றார்.

'சுத்த ஸ்படிகம்' அமைதியான சூழ்நிலையில் எழும் சப்தங்களை கிரகித்துக்கொள்ளும். இது ஸ்படிகத்தின் குணம், தன்மை. 'ஸ்வேதம்பரராகவும்' 'ஸ்படிகமாகவும்' இருக்கும் சிவபெருமானை தியானித்து அந்த சப்தங்களை மீட்க முடியும்.

உடனே சகாதேவனும் வியாசரும், பீஷ்மர் சஹஸ்ரநாமம் சொல்லிய அதே இடத்தில் அமர்ந்தனர். சகாதேவன் மஹாதேவரை பிரார்த்தித்து, தியானம் செய்து சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை மீட்கத் துவங்கினர்.

அந்த 'சுத்த ஸ்படிக' மாலையே உலகின் முதல் 'வாய்ஸ் ரிகார்டராக', அற்புதமான விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை நமக்குத் தந்தது...........”

என்று சொல்லி குழந்தைபோல சிரித்தார் ஸ்ரீசரணர்.

------------------------------------------------------
பெரியவாள் வாழும் காலத்திலே நாமும் வாழ்கிறோம் என்பதுதான் எத்தனை பெரிய பாக்யம் !

அவரைப் பார்ப்பதற்கும் அவரது அருள் வாக்கைக் கேட்பதற்கும் என்ன தவம் செய்தோமோ?

07/02/17, 9:40 AM - Paiya perrippa: பீஷ்ம ஏகாதசி ! "ஸ்ரீ விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமம்" பிறந்த நாள் ! (7-2-2017)

குருக்ஷேத்ரத்தில் தான் கண்ணன் சொன்ன பகவத் கீதையும் தோன்றியது, கண்ணன் கேட்ட "விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ர நாமமும் " தோன்றியது. எனவேதான் குருக்ஷேத்ரம், தர்மக்ஷேத்ரம் என்று போற்றப்படுகிறது. இரண்டும் தோன்றியது ஒரு ஏகாதசியில் தான் !

பீஷ்ம பிதாமகர் அம்பு படுக்கையில் இருக்கும் சமயம், பாண்டவர்கள் ஸ்ரீ கிருஷ்ணனுடன் சென்று அவரை வணங்குகிறார்கள். அப்போது ஸ்ரீ கிருஷ்ணன் பீஷ்மரை, பாண்டவர்களுக்கு தர்மத்தை உபதேசிக்கும்படி கோருகிறார். பீஷ்மரும் அவ்வாறே அவர்களுக்கு பல தர்மோபதேசங்களை செய்து விட்டு, ஸ்ரீமன் நாராயணனின் பெருமைகளை போற்றும் " ஸ்ரீ விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமம் " என்ற திவ்ய ஸ்தோத்ரத்தையும் உபதேசிக்கிறார். இப்படிப்பட்ட ஆயிரம் நாமங்களால் போடப்படும் ஸ்ரீ மஹா விஷ்ணு வேறு யாரும் அல்லர். அவரேதான் இந்த ஸ்ரீ கிருஷ்ணர் ! என்ற உண்மையையும் கூறி ஸ்ரீ பரந்தாமனை வணங்குகிறார். 

இந்த புண்ணிய நாள், பீஷ்ம பிதாமகரின் பெயரால் "பீஷ்ம ஏகாதசி " என்றே வழங்கபடுகிறது. இந்த வருடம் "பீஷ்ம ஏகாதசி ", வரும்  (7-2-2017) அன்று வருகிறது .

ஸ்ரீ விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமம் அவதரித்த இந்த நன்னாளில் நாம் அனைவரும் தவறாமல் " ஸ்ரீ விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாமத்தை" பாராயணம் செய்வோம் ( தினமுமே "ஸ்ரீ விஷ்ணு சஹஸ்ரநாம பாராயணம் " செய்வது நற்பலன்கள் தரும்.

10/02/17, 8:09 AM - Paiya perrippa: *இது அரசியல் பதிவு அல்ல,  திரு. OPS அவர்களின் செயல் நமக்கு உணர்த்தும் பாடம்*                                      . நிறைவாகும் வரை... மறைவாக இரு! - ஓ.பன்னீர்செல்வம் கற்றுக்கொடுத்த பாடங்கள்!

வீடு, அலுவலகம், சமூக வெளி என்று எங்கெங்கே நாம் எப்படி எப்படியெல்லாம் இருக்க வேண்டும் என்று ஒரு பாடத்தை, ஒரே நாளில் கற்றுக் கொடுத்திருக்கிறார் ஓ.பன்னீர்செல்வம்.       

*எதையும் 5 நிமிடம் தள்ளிப்போடுங்கள்:-*

‘எந்த ஒரு பெரிய முடிவெடுக்கறதுக்கு முன்னாலயும், அஞ்சு நிமிஷம் யோசி’ என்பார்கள். இவர் அதை 8 மடங்கு பின்பற்றியிருக்கிறார். நேற்று 40 நிமிடம் இவர் மெரினாவில் அமைதியாக அமர்ந்திருந்தது, எல்லாரும் பின்பற்ற வேண்டிய விஷயம். மீடியா வரக் காத்திருந்ததாக இருக்கலாம். ஆனால், அதை அவர் வீட்டில் செய்யாமல், அலுவலகத்தில் செய்யாமல் அமைதியான ஓர் இடம் தேடி வந்து அமர்ந்தது... To be noted. எதைப் பேசவேண்டும், எப்படிப் பேசவேண்டும் என்று அவர் மனதில் எல்லா கேள்விகளையும், எல்லா கோணங்களிலும் சிந்தித்து அந்தப் பேட்டியைக் கொடுக்க அவருக்கு அந்த 40 நிமிடங்கள் பெரும் உதவி புரிந்திருக்கும்.

*புன்னகையில் குழப்புங்கள்*

‘எதிரியாக இருந்தாலும் புன்னகையுங்கள்’ என்று தன்னம்பிக்கை வகுப்புகளில் சொல்வார்கள். அது எதிரியைக் குழப்பும். அல்லது நெருக்கமாக்கும். இவர் எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவரைப் பார்த்து புன்னகைத்தது, உடன் இருந்தவர்களையே கலங்கடித்திருக்கிறது. 

இதைப் படிக்கலைனா படிச்சிருங்க 

*​மன இறுக்கத்தை முகத்தில் காட்ட வேண்டிய அவசியம் இல்லை*

இந்த வரிகள் இவரே சொன்னதுதான். எந்த நிலையிலும் இவர் தனது மன இறுக்கத்தை, முகத்தில் காட்டியதில்லை. ஒரு முதலமைச்சராக இருந்து, அலங்காநல்லூர் சென்றார். ஊருக்குள் செல்ல அனுமதி இல்லை. புன்னகை மாறாமல் பேட்டி கொடுத்துவிட்டு திரும்பி வந்துவிட்டார். இவரைப் பற்றிய விமர்சனங்கள் பற்றிக் கேட்டபோது, “பொது வாழ்க்கைக்கு வந்துவிட்டால் இவற்றையெல்லாம் எதிர்கொள்ளத்தான் வேண்டும்” என்றார். இத்தனை நாட்களும், தான் மன அழுத்தத்தோடு இருந்ததாகச் சொன்னார். ஆனால் அதை வெளிக்காட்டாமல் பூட்டி வைத்துக் கொண்டிருந்தார். உணர்ச்சிகளைக் கட்டுப்படுத்து! 

*எதிரிகளையும் மதியுங்கள்*

பேட்டிகளில், ‘சின்னம்மா’ என்றுதான் சொல்கிறார். ஆனால் அவர் மூலம் பாதிக்கப்பட்டதை அழுத்தமாகவே பதிவு செய்கிறார். ‘காலம் கனியும் போது அவர் முதல்வராகட்டும்’ என்கிறார். எந்த இடத்திலும் எதிராளியைக் காயப்படுத்தவோ, தரம் தாழ்ந்து பேசவோ இல்லை. 

*உணர்வுகளுக்கு மதிப்பளியுங்கள்*

“ஷீலா பாலகிருஷ்ணன் பதவி விலகுவதாய் அறிவித்தது குறித்து அவரிடம் பேசினீர்களா?” என்று கேட்டதற்கு ஓ.பன்னீர்செல்வம் சொன்ன பதில்: “இல்லை. அது அவரது பெர்சனல் காரணமாகக் கூட இருக்கலாம். அவர் உணர்வை மதித்து, உடனே கேட்டு அவரை சங்கடத்திற்கு ஆளாக்க வேண்டாம். 15-20 நாட்கள் கழித்துப் பேசலாம் என்று இருந்தேன்” என்றிருக்கிறார். 

*நெருக்கமாக இருங்கள்*

‘வணக்கம் திரு பன்னீர்செல்வம்' என்று பெயர் சொல்லித்தான் பேசுகிறார்கள் மீடியாவில். பெயர் சொல்லி அழைக்கிற முதல்வரை தமிழ்நாடு பார்த்து வருடங்கள் ஆகிறது. இந்த நெருக்கம் பேணுதல், ஒரு லீடருக்குரிய முக்கிய க்வாலிட்டி.  

*குதிரையை விடுங்கள். லகான் கையில் இருக்கட்டும்.*

உங்கள் குதிரை சாலையில் பறக்கட்டும். ஆனால் அதன் லகான் உங்கள் கையில் இருக்கட்டும் என்பதாக பரபரப்பான ஒரு விஷயத்தைப் பகிர்ந்த பிறகு ஓ.பன்னீர்செல்வம் சொல்கிறார்; ‘100%-ல் 10% மட்டும்தான் பேசியிருக்கிறேன்’. ஆக, இன்னும் ஏதேதோ இருக்கிறது என்று எதிரிகளை கிலியிலேயே வைத்திருக்கிறார்.

*பணிவாக இரு*

இதுவரை இவருக்கு ஒரு அடைமொழி இல்லை. முதலமைச்சராக இருந்தும், அதைக்கூட சொல்லாமல் ‘ஓ.பன்னீர்செல்வம்’ என்றோ, ‘ஓபிஎஸ்’ என்றோதான் அழைக்கப்படுகிறார். ‘ஓபிஎஸ்தான் வரணும்’ என்று எவரோ கத்த, திரும்பி ‘ஓபிஎஸ் என்றில்லை. மக்கள் விரும்புகிற யார் வேண்டுமானாலும் ஆளலாம்’ என்கிறார். பிறரெல்லாம் இரட்டை இலை என்று சின்னமான வெற்றி முத்திரையைக் காட்ட, இவர் கையைக் கும்பிட்டுக்கொண்டேதான் நகர்கிறார். 

எல்லாவற்றையும்விட, இவர் சொல்லியிருக்கிற இன்னொரு பாடம்: ‘நிறைவாகும் வரை, மறைவாக இரு!’ . இத்தனை நாள் கற்றுக் கொண்டு, தன்னை முன்னிறுத்தாமல் இருந்து, இப்போது தக்க சமயத்தில் தன்னை வெளிப்படுத்திக் கொள்கிறார்.

அரசியலில் எதுவும் எப்போது வேண்டுமானாலும் மாறும். இன்றைக்கு விஸ்வரூபம் எடுத்திருக்கும் ஓ. பன்னீர்செல்வம், நாளைக்கு என்ன செய்வார் என்பது யாருக்கும் தெரியாது. இருந்தாலும் இன்னைக்குக் கத்துக்கலாம் மக்களே.. கற்றுக் கொண்டால் குற்றமில்லை
10/02/17, 8:24 AM - Vidya Perima: கடலில் விளையாடிக் கொண்டிருந்த சிறுவனின் செருப்பு காணாமல் போய்விட்டது. அவன் உடனே கடற்கரையில் எழுதினான், “இந்தக் கடல் மாபெரும் திருடன்...!” 

கொஞ்சம் தூரத்தில் ஒருவர் அதிகமாக மீன்பிடித்துக் கொண்டிருந்தார். அவர் நினைத்ததை விடவும் அதிகமாக மீன்கள் வலையில் சிக்கின. அவர் அக்கடற்கரையில் எழுதினார், “இக்கடல் பெரும் கொடையாளியப்பா...!” 

அதே கடலில் ஒருவன் நீந்தச் சென்று மூழ்கிவிட்டான். மகன் மீது அதிக பிரியமுடன் இருந்த அவன் தாய் அக்கடற்கரையில் எழுதினாள், "இக்கடல் மக்களை கொன்று குவிக்கின்றதே...!” 

ஓர் வயது முதிர்ந்த மனிதர் கடலுக்குச் சென்று முத்துக்களை வேட்டையாடிக்கொண்டு வந்தார். அவர் மிக்க மகிழ்ச்சியோடு அக்கடற்கரையில் எழுதினார், “இந்தக் கடல் ஒன்றே போதும். நான் ஆயுள் முழுக்க மகிழ்ச்சியோடு இருக்கலாம்...!”

ஓர் பெரும் அலை வந்து இவர்கள் அனைவரும் எழுதியவற்றை அழித்துவிட்டுச்சென்றது.

பிறர் கூறுவதை காதில் வாங்கிக் கொள்ளாதே. 

இவ்வுலகை ஒவ்வொருவரும் ஒவ்வொரு கோணத்தில் பார்க்கின்றனர்.

உன் நட்பும், சகோதரத்துவமும் நிலைக்க வேண்டுமானால் நீ பிறரின் தவறுகளை உன் மனதிலிருந்து அழித்துவிடு. 

தவறுக்காக உன் நட்பையோ, சகோதரத்துவத்தையோ அழித்துவிடாதே.

நீ ஓர் கெடுதியை சந்திக்க நேர்ந்தால் அதை விடவும் பலமாக அதற்கு பதிலடி கொடுக்க வேண்டுமென ஒரு போதும் எண்ணாதே.

சிறிது சிந்தித்து, நளினமாக அதை கையாளு........
